    This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

    The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is \"dust\" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

    Display quality is good. But one thing which I don't like about the camera is that we can't use flash light when we take shots with 64 MP lens. Low light photographs are also not upto the mark. Rest everything is fine.

    Worst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,

    Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons <U+0001F61C>). Think before buying this phone.

Four cameras including of 64Mega pixels. Giving amazing performance.Amoled display giveing different view for all applications as well as photos.Cameras giving high quality of the photos with as on view . No more high make over.Connecting with other made very easy with in one or two steps. Like WIFI, TV,and other device's.Awesome battery. Proofing Mega monster.Awesome storage also a mega monster.Well improved security level, face detection.Notification also customised as different level.New type of notification sounds are good.From the date of purchasing till iam not faced any hanging and heating problem.Compass aquricy also well and good.I feel only one disadvantage is remote sensor.The remote sensor not in this mobile.

    1. Camera is not up to the expectation2. Battery doesn't seem to be 6000 Mah it hardly last 1 day further takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to get fully charged worried if this is huge battery life and fast charging, what will be the normal one from Samsung.Hope the company have test check the features, if not kindly do it to get the correct facts.Other brands which are way smaller than the samsung brand offer better performance.

    I feel cheated. This phone sucks. Battery lasts less than my 4000 mah battery. The \"64mp\" camera shows more blurriness and pixels than my redmi note 7 pro which has 48mp camera.The phone's screen also looks kinda cheap although performs well, the build quality of the device is far bellow standards. Extremely disappointed. Beware. This phone has many PAID reviews that speak highly about this device.

    Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

    I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!

    The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCTNow with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.

    Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone

    Hardware is top notch. The software leaves a bad impression. Especially the galaxy store during setup. It attempted to download and install lot of applications during initial setup. This must be the way the manufacturer tried to subsidize the product i can understand. But it was a nightmare to setup. The one ui is not so great when compared to stock Android and feels spammy.

    sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.

    Very bad product. There are so many issue.1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.3. Sound is also not good.4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.Don't buy.

     I am using this Megaphone from last 4 days. Here is review-1. As claimed the strongest part of this phone is Mega Battery and it's TRUE in every term. With moderate use throughout the day Battery was down to 80% only from full charged in morning. I watched movies for another 2 hours continuously reducing only 10% further to 70%. charging 1 hr was sufficient to get back to 100%. Totally Impressive!!2. Camera is phenomenal. Wide angle, super slomo video, hyperlapse, clicks with auto adjustment, night mode, zoom.. all are best in every term. I have attached few clicks & videos. Check out3. Very user friendly functions. Everything seems so simple. That's best part too.4. I used Samsung smart switch app to transfer my entire data from my old android phone to this one. Without any hiccups totally got that done in one go everything including messages, call records. Everything in matter of hour. Seamless experience.4. You can create your own emoji. Best part- you can use while using camera too!Overall totally happy with the purchase of this mobile.

    Best Mobile for this price. Camera is par at the best. Both the front and rear cameras are excellent and the result is very detailed and very minute, previously was using Vivo V9 that to bought at Amazon. Low light photography is ok. Touch is excellent. Battery back up is also very good. Processing is very good without any lagging and no heating issues even at very very long usage, almost day long. Stylish and the curved edge screen is excellent

    I am updating my old review because Samsung has provided excellent service via email to troubleshoot my galaxy M31 download struck issue, the mobile is performed well as of now, it is an excellent mobile because I am surprised when others are provided good feedback on my video call, the pics are also awesome, I have taken my little daughter's pic which was my favourite photo ever with this awesome Galaxy M31 mobile.If you want to know about my previous problem here it is, but Samsung solved it remotely without visiting the service center.:Galaxy M31 stuck at 'Downloading...Do not turn off target', ODIN MODE (AVB Fail)SUPER: Build-id does not match with the reference(SUPER) : 30278215R, (BOOTLOADER) : 29256088I have tried to restart using Volume down+power button then samsung logo comes and then immediately it shows Downloading... blue screen. Tried many times but no use at all, My daily work is purely depending on this mobile but due to this problem I cannot use this mobile at all now, this will make my days too dangerous about my job during this corona lock down,  so contacted  samsungchat assistant but they suggested to visit the service center, but due corona lock down no service center available, I do not understand why should I visit the service center because it is a software problem not the hardware problem, I have tried to search the issue in Google it seems most of the Galaxy M31 mobiles facing the same issue, so I suggest samsung people should look into this issue ASAP and resolve it automatically without visiting the service centre by force update some thing

    Please don't buy this phone. It has major heating issues. It gets drastically heated while watching videos, while taking photos, during calls and also while charging. 6000mah battery is just for name sake. It works for 1 to 1.25 days without heavy usage. Full charging takes upto 3hrs. Speaker quality is also bad.The only good thing about this phone is camera.

    I was a Samsung C9pro user for past 3 years , the migration to M31 was pretty easy with smart switch, other than few credit card apps none of the  other apps recognise the move, face unlock it works and it doesn't, phone battery stays for one and half day with dual SIM,  figner print scanner improved a lot, camera is also better with correct light, phone casting to TV is not crashing , however  photo quality when we view on a 4k TV is not great, android auto also much stable, Bluetooth connectivity with both smart watch and car works seamlessly.

    The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for the following reasons.(after using for 3 days).1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.Thank you SAMSUNG

    It is very disappointing that phone has heating issue. On simple use you will feel the heat and once you have played any game then it is like old iron. It is heat the upper part of phone i.e. camera side.On the other hand screen stuck while using whatapps. Screen touch start working abnormal. I have brought  2 handsets i feel similar  issues in both of the handsets.I am not a tech bug but second phone user has raised concern  to amazon they have ask to install diagnostic  software  after that i have no idea what they have done to his handset.

    Its almost 1 month since i bought this mobile. 1st impression is impressive... you cannot resist picking  it up again and again... check every angle.. every service. Every settings... its marvelous...Camera is good for normal user... but for pro's i would not recommend it.. though you can work it out with little change in settings and here and there... autofocus is not that good but definitely not that bad too... fingerprint gives trouble sometime but other than that it works like a charm... the only issue i had it that samsung did not provide  a light border around it... so user could feel it and pace finger correctly.. the day it arrived.. i downloaded many application from microsoft word to evernote... whatsapp to skype pubG to candy crush... more the 150 app are there currently on my device but no issue of speed while switching 1 to another.. though it gets little heat up while playing pubG but not that much... and lo lagging  so far...And above all boss 6000 mah battery... for normal user ... if you charge your phn 100% and in normal use taking phone calls.. texting chatting..listening music.. playing normal games... it last 70-75 % at the end of day... woooow...I am not an high end user... and i am well aware about price range... so for me ints 4 out of 5... but for those who need everything perfect kindly incrrase your budget till 20k i must say m31 slay every predator around it.....

    Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) is an average low mid range product for a reasonable price. It is as fast as my Galaxy S7, but not as fast as S20. Please don't buy this phone expecting to be flagship Galaxy S20. You get what you pay for. No complains so far.The Good:1) Finger Print Reader is good - unlocks in 1 to 1.5 seconds2) Battery Life is good - 1.5 days of usableThe Average:1) Camera is average, please don't expect it to deliver S20 Quality Pictures, remember, you have paid 1/3 of S20 price.The Ugly:1) Bloatware from Google & Samsung

    Nothing much to say about disliking,Because I love this phone,Camera quality is best,Battery life was my preferred thing to look for and so now I dont have to worry about it after buying this phone.Finger print reader is working best, as previously I used some other phones whose finger print reader did suck after using for a month, but Samsung so far has done a wonderful quality built.I am happy and I know it.

    I was looking for a budget phone with a decent battery and camera.Samsung M31 seemed to fit in that category perfectly.Pros1) A gigantic battery of 6000mah with a 15v quick charging option. Gives you so much relaxation when you are using multiple things through the day. Have sailed through a day without battery charging.2) The Live focus feature on the camera works pretty well for the price it is being offered.3) Great captures with minute detail capturing under ample light. I am yet to use it under low light.4) Pretty lightweight for a phone with such huge battery size5) Two Sim card slots plus a memory card slot over and above the 128 GB storage is a bonus6) A secretly hid Dolby Atmos feature which adds quite an impact on the sound when on bluetooth or earphoneCons1) A very outdated processor which doesn't do justice to the 6GB Ram being offered. The functioning is quite okay2) Need to really work on the Face Unlock technology. I had to stop using face unlock on the second day because I was tired of so many disapproval from my phone3) Once you disconnect the call there is a 2 second lag for the call screen to go away which gets pretty annoying.4) Lot of redundant apps being given with the phone and loads of unwanted samsung apps attached which doesn't add value to your functions.5) Plastic body with multiple hand prints if being used with a cover.Overall If you are looking for  a budget phone with amazing camera and battery this is your phone. But if you are too much into gaming configuration it is not going to entice you much.

    Satisfied...very good performance and as expected..Amazon prompt delivery appreciableThis is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.

    Received this from Amazon a week back. Here is review after a week's usage -1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MPFront, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp,  fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features & usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.

    Great phone for camera and battery and the screen looks so premium thanks for the superamoled with 60hz...and the battery easily lasts for one and half day...not sure about gaming though..if u don't play games for hours then it's the best pick

    Even though on the bulkier side compared to A and S series, M31 is a great phone given the 6000mah battery. This lasts me the whole day on a single charge.The charger could have been 18+watts and the cable length is pathetic. Not even 0.8 M. Disappointed in the cable.Decent camera, easy set up using smart switch.Also brought a Redmi 8A dual and this phone is only slightly better

    Not happy with camara back and Front, even front camera is perform like VGA camera.Also full plastic body seems Samsung made this PRODUCT by mistake and we buy to consider Samsung brand !Compare to this other all phone are best in quality and money saver too with aluminum body!Feeling like we fool that use this phone and can't return coz loackdown immediately after buy \"covid 19\"This phone is a big black spot on Samsung brand image, I strongly recommend not to buy this.Night mode also not working face unlock is also frustrating and not working most of time.

Camera quality is more then average but definently not the best apart from it i love the price tag in which its available.So kudos to M series .Yet to explore its functions till date doing good.Value for money i will say.

    I am using this device from last 20 hours.. My first impressions are as below.Display-Super Amoled. Best in class. You will love it.Camara-Rear camera performs  very well. No complaint.Front camera is not up to mark. But overall good quality.Processor - I am  not  heavy user.  It performs daily  tasks  very well.Fingerprint- Quite  fastNetwork Speed- very goodBattery- It gave me almost 4 hours screen time from 52% battery and 15% battery is still left. So it is excellent.Software- One Ui very best.. many customization options.Charging Speed- Not testedBuild Quality- You have to compromise with plastic back. But glossy finish looks premium.

    Recently I purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 on Amazon. I have been using this phone for past 2 weeks and here are my feedbacks.Pros:Color of the phone is really cool and looks awesome.Loading of apps is fasterFront and Back camera is really good and output of the pictures are excellent during the day-light.Audio quality using headphones gives you a different experience altogether.Battery life lasts for 48-72 hours, if you are a regular user. If you are heavy user it should last some where between 23 to 36 hours.Cons:Pictures taken in night mode is decent.The phone gets slighted heated when you are using for a longer duration.

    This new Samsung beast is monster in every aspect i.e., monster 6000mah battery, monster 64MP main rear camera, monster super amoled full HD+ display, and many more.. This new monster is very slim and very easy to handle and use. 4 different camera lenses helps us to captureevery type of shot as we seek in a perfect manner.Other phones Samsung don't give 6000 mah battery with the 64 MP camera and super amoled full HD display altogether at this rate.15W fast charger takes almost 1.5-2 hours to charge this big batteryvwhich lasts for almost 2 days with normal internet and other uses.So one must go for this M31 because at this price, this is the only one phone in this segment which provides customer all types of major functions at this rate.

But i need some more develop in software like adding more fingerprint two to three.Anyways I Give five <U+0001F31F> star out of Five because i share  my feedback with you after 15 days of the purchased. It's my suggestion for you don't buy unknown Brand Galaxy M31 bit all Letest and C*****Mobile

    Excellent price point.Display is excellent.Very fast processor.Fingerprint reader is fast and accurate for the price point.Camera is excellent. Sharp and accurate colors and image reproduction.Battery Life is awesome. It lasts about 18 hours on hevay usage.Microphone placement is some issue. Many times finger accidentally covers it, leading to voice not reaching the person at other end of call. One has to be very careful not to cover the microphone accidentally.

    The mobile is beyond my expectation except in one thing. It has good camera quality when you take photos in good lighting. And the night mode is above the average. Sound quality, I found it to be very good in all the aspect. Display, very good quality. Battery life, it does worth very much to wait for 2.5 Hr charging time as it last for more than one and half day for the moderate users. By the way I didn't check if it really takes 2.5 Hr to charge up. I just go by the reviews which claims the same.And finally that one thing which has disappointed me is that this model don't have inbuilt music player.

    Such a awesome phone at a good price. The battery is big beast and even camera can be seen like fabulous, images are such a beast one's and night shot is lit. I loved this phone and everyone should read this review and should buy this mega monster. Pros: 1. Good camera 2. Big battery Even it lasts 3 days and for standby it may lasts for 5 to 6 days 3. Big storage 4. Super amoled display is lit. 5. For gaming its beastPUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop. 6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category. Cons: 1. Slightly heats up while charging. I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.

    I am a fan of Samsung mobile. Earlier I had Samsung on8 phone which was good. I wanted a phone with a large display and large storage. So I decided to go for Samsung m31. This is the best mobile at this rate. Display is great, camera is good with good pictures. Capacitive touchscreen is smooth, fingerprint scan is great, face detection is good, quality of phone is good and lightweight. Battery is superb. Phone does not heat too much but I am not sure about gaming which I do no use much. Connectivity is great as well. So if you want a mobile with these kind of features then go for this.

    Phone hangs and some times Apps are hanging. Not able to open apps like WhatsApp or games. I need to restart the phone multiple times. Phone gets heated up and charging very slowly. don't know if this is only with my phone or with every buyer of this product. Amazon gave just 10 days of replacement, which isn't sufficient for an end customer to come back on the product, if it is faulty.It's just not even a month after buying this phone and really struggling with this now. regret a lot about buying this product now.Can Samsung or amazon do anything for this to resolve my problem? Can they help me?

    This is one of the most fantastic mobile devices of recent times. With excellent speed and a monster battery which goes on and on, it's is truly a fantabulous package from Samsung at an affordable price. A lovely camera which beautifully alters and optimises your old pics. A good finger print reader, a device to scan QR code, the list is endless. Thanks Samsung for making such a thoughtful device for first time Samsung users like me and turning them to become your brand ambassadors for this lovely device.

But it takes 1.5 hrs to charge it full.Look: it's good, look wise with smoothies edges. Gives you a feel of curve edge

Heats up!! Yes you heard it right ,mobile heats up quickly while gamingOverall its a good midrange phone, best for day to day use in this segment, if you are gamer then i think you are in wrong place(unless samsung rectifies it by update).Most importantly delivery is super fast.

    I have always been a loyal customer with Samsung since 2004. I had just started thinking of switching \"BRANDS\" this time. On my lookout, i came across Samsung Galaxy M31 and did a detailed comparison with other competitive brands & found  Samsung Galaxy M31 to be far more superior than the rest. This was justified with my purchase.  So far no complaints.....Pro's:  One day delivery, Best Battery life, Rear Camera is excellent, Front Camera is good,  Finger print & Face Unlock has quick response.Con's: NIL so far

    Intially phone was working good but after normal use of 2 months, it started taking too long in charging, and charging speed after 75% becomes very less.I can say time taken in charging after 75% is twice of time taken upto initial 75%.Samsung customer care suggested charge in different modes, change charger, charging chord etc.I did everything but still issue is same. At last just waiting to visit samsung service center once situation becomes normal and government lifts restrictions.

    1. Truely a mega monster in terms of battery backup , camera quality ( in terms of zooming it provides ) , samoled display.2. Make sure that the product you get is free from defects . Proximity sensor of my m31 doesn't work perfectly .3. Charging takes a lot of time (2.5 hrs for 0 to 100% ) as charger is of 15 w power.4. I faced hanging problem which is faced by many others with other samsung smartphones.Personally am not very happy with product due to hanging issue.

    Meanwhile using this device, i find it slow with respect to the 6gb ram mobile devices.It is taking time in switching apps, opening apps and sometimes getting stuck until i clear the memory.Also I'm unable to find what is using half(3gb) of my ram as only 2.9 gb is available to use after clearing memory. (500mb of ram is reserved).Camera is good.Display is good.

    Screen as it says is SAMOLED is truly wonderful.Camera both fromt and back serves the purpose.Fingerprint i am bit disappointed,  as it is not as fast as it should be and battery life as it says 6000mah, but i believe it work as around 4750mah which is 1 day on full charge and after having video call for 2hrs and normal use.But charging is fast as it says at 15W.Overall at this price one should really go fir this.

    Unbelievable  from Samsung. The fast charging is good. Charges within  2 hours. Smooth experience in using. The quad camera design  is outstanding. It deserves  a 5 star. Thanks to Amazon free fast delivery.  I received the product in 26 hours after order.Personally calculated  charging speed 0.5percent to 0.6 percent per minute.approx 2hour 42min to 3hour 18 min for 0 to 100 percent on switch off charging.

    A perfect budget smartphone. Trust on samsung. Awesome display, speakers are loud and clear enough.Nice camera in this budget. Its a battery monster powered by 6000 mah battery. Light weight...weight distribution is very nicely done. A 6GB variant at this price range is a nice deal with this package.As per my usage it's a good deal for me.

    One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.1. Heating issue2. Second sim works on 3g.3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.

    I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 <U+2B50><U+FE0F>)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex

    Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

    (After 10 days usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

    I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

    Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

    There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.

    First time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.Bad experience.Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well

    Good things are1.Awesome cameras, both front and rear (a shot using macro mode is attached)2.Excellent processing speed3.Battery withstands more than 30 hours ( all time mobile data enabled, camera was used many times, normal WhatsApp usage but I never play video games).4. Wonderful display experience (far better than my previous (Galaxy on next)5. Low SAR value (0.38 W/kg as per manual) and No heating issues during the above mentioned usage.6. Highly comfortable UI to use the phone7. Face recognition is good (can't find fault)8. All the features are really good and high end configuration under Rs. 150009. I feel Very comfortable to have this phone and it is really worthyImprovements required are1. Call volume is little less and loud speaker volume also littleless (I don't have any hearing issues)2. It takes more than a hour to fully charge But it may be acceptable because of 6000 mAh Battery.3. Samsung should have sold this good phone with headphone. So, without headphone I feel this sale is incomplete

    Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.Facial recognition takes a lot of timeConclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme

    I have noticed below issues with phone.* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.Also battery drains out easily* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.

    The Box Contents :The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related PapersFirst Impressions :The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.After a week usuge:1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.

    It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace <U+270C><U+FE0F> continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs

    Consider Other choices also.Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.No notification LED.Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.

    The above stars are only for battery, AI features and camera.CONS :1) SLIGHT HEATING ISSUE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND AS WELL IN THE BACK2) WIDE ANGLE CAMERA IS NOT CLEAN IF YOU TRY TO ZOOM IN AT ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT4) POSITION OF SPEAKER IS POOR AS IT GETS BLOCKED WITH FINGERS WHILE PLAYING GAMES OR TEXTING . THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DUAL SPEAKER.3) NO HEADPHONE AND COVER INSIDE THE BOX4)GIVEN 6000MAH BATTERY , IT WILL LAST ONLY 1/2 HALF DAYS , WHICH IS OK COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES5) 15W CHARGER TAKES 2:30 hrs TO COMPLETE 100%, WHERE AS IF YOU CHARGE THEM THROUGH Mi POWER BANK WITH 18W SPEED IT COMPLETES BIT QUICKER.6) BIT SLIPPERY IN CORNERS COZ OF WHICH FINDING DIFFICULT TO PLAY GAMES. HOWEVER CASE CAN ELIMINATE THIS ISSUE7) POOR NIGHT VISION CAMERA.8) FINGER PRINT UNLOCKER  AS USUAL POOR IN SAMSUNGPROS:- FRONT AND BACK CAMERA ARE AWESOME UNDER LIGHTING.- LASTS 1 AND HALF DAYS OF BATTERY IN EXTREME USE.-GAMING AND SOME AI FEATURES ARE GOOD.

    So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9. Headphone is not given with phone.

    This phone has more than everything I expected. My favorite is this Super AMOLED screen just <U+0001F618>.Pros-superb battery. 1- 1.5 dayCamera (Rear camera is on other level) + AR Emoji6 GB Ram (more than my laptop)Very nice call quality (I uses Airtel)Finger print sensor is fast.Selfie is better in natural lightingDedicated Memory card slot.Charging speed is not that slow.Feels very nice in hand and can be easily hold in one hand.Cons-Face unlock is slowww and few times didn't worked.Can't uninstall Netflix, Facebook and few other Samsung's app but these can be disabled.Got around 50 GB out of 64 GB.No back cover provided in box.Finger prints are all over the back.VerdictBest phone to buy around this budget. Super value for money. I am very happy to have this phone.Don't think just buy it. You won't regret.

    Product is very good. This mobile phone has best battery backup. Anyone can think 6000 mah battery with 64 mp rear back camera and 32 mp front camera. The fingerprint is responding so fast. Fack lock is outstanding. Security level is very good. This mobile phone has mamy more features like- screenshot with hand. Screen display is very smooth with gorilla glass. The Samsung prosser of this phone is best for gaming. The ram is very good and rom also. This phone also produces just small amount of radiation compare to other phone. I think this mobile can beat I phone also and at last I recommend this phone to that who want  mobile phone working for 2 or 3 year. I really....... Like this phone Samsung. Your company is best for me.

    I got it on Saturday morning. You will get a mobile and charge. Which is OK. No phone cover, no earphone, no screen glass.Everything is fine now coming on the battery part.6000mh honestly??? I charged it 100 percent in the night and today in the evening It was 56 and I didn't used it a lot. But I think it is okay in this price range ... I don't play games but if you are a games lovers. You need to think it twice. battery part is a questionable thing.Face lock doesn't work properly. Sometimes it recognizes your face and sometimes it doesn't

    Firstly I was impressed by the delivery of the phone it was in my hand in just 10 hours after I book the phone in Amazon. Great job from Amazon.Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG.

    I being using this device from the date of sale. As per my usage Battery bit draining fast and not up to expected mark as 6000maH. Battery working as same as 4000mah. And for PUBG kind of huge GB games graphics is lagging in this device. Gaming display not looks great.

    I ordered this set on the first day and the delivery was amazing.All the features of this phone are as advertised. The outer body is same as that of Galaxy M30s and M30. A little on the thick side due to 6000mAh battery.Camera and battery life are excellent. The charger that came along with my set was white in colour.Though, there is a bug in the phone (which is also found in Galaxy S10+) where the in-call speaker becomes your primary speaker. You can google about this bug. Hopefully, samsung will resolve it in the future updates.Android 10 and one core is great. There are application like Bixby vision, AR emojis which is novel and interesting. Game launcher is also great in managing and organizing games.Back cover is must as the back panel is shiny and smudges doesn't look great. Overall, the phone is great and price is reasonable.

    Display - It is great. Great display of colours on this large screen. Score - 4.5/5Camera - In videos image stabilisation is great. AI camera is also fine Night mode is fine. Problem is in colour correction feature when you want to see picture after zoom in. But that's not feature of mid range phone camera. So can overlook. Score - 4/5Processor - Best in same ranges phone. Better geek bench score than snapdragon of same range. Score - 5/5Handling - Heavy because their is 6000mah battery. Score - 3.5/5Performance - Heating not properly tested till now. Overall it is fine under heavy usage also. Score - 4/5Overall - 4/5Recommended for under 20k budget. Best phone till march 2020.

    I'm very much happy with the quality of phone samsung come up with .But I m much disappointed with the people's I don't know wheather they are from samsung or any third party agency of samsung  , calling me every day and forcing to write review, in addition of that they are arguing for the same , that's too much pathetic.What's wrong !!! Hallo !That's not sales , that's not how it works ,people's are writing their review if they really feels good , you cannot force !! If you do so it will always have a bad effect for one's who really developed this nice gadget.That's  very wrong gesture just to get catch few review to increase sales . But believe me that may have wrong effect too..Like I rated 2 star for a such nice phone which  deserves at least 4 star ....

    Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without doubtbest thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India seller. I ordered on the first day 5th March 2020 of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 50% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!!  Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received two day later  by 6 pm!Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

    Finger print reader lags a bit and is not as fast as the phones other competitors whereas the camera is definitely worth the price (In fact more than value for money). I have compared M31's camera with other brands such as OnePlus and it gives them a competition (But obviously not overpowering them). Bettery life is something that I shouldn't even speak about, the phone lasts for more than 1.5 days for me and when full charged .... <U+0001F602> 6000mah is all I need to say. This pgone overall is totally worth it, no lags as such. Samsung phones generally have poor GPS but there's no such problem with this phone. If you are looking for a phone under 15K then this should be your buy.

    Samsunga galaxy m31 is a decent buy in this category, this phone is suitable for thoose persons which are not too much into gaming altough games work as charm in this one still not recommended fir intense gaming.Pros°Awesome battery life, it is what it is claimed Monster.°Camera quality is decent° display is awesome° very light weight considering a 6000 mah battery°android 10 and one ui 2.0 works like charmCons°Cheap plastic made although it will affect you still glass would have been preferred° when you second zoom in pics even in daylight the quality is bad° slutters in intense games°fingerprint sensor is small for big fingers although this is the same fingerprint sensor used on all samsung phones in this category still samsung needs to change the diameter of the sensor, response is quick thoughCONCLUSION: if you are really tech savvy, gaming type of person then this is not the right phone for you but if you need some brand value and a decent phone which can handle day to day tasks with ease then go for it.

    1-The Galaxy M family has now transformed into a much bigger lineup and garnered a lot of attention,2-It offers very good battery life dats long for a 2 & half day backup..3-Scrolling through One UI 2.0 was smooth and apps were quick to open as well. Throughout our week-long usage, we did not encounter any slowdown or lags while using different day-to-day apps for messaging, social media browsing and so on. 4-it does manage to click shots that are generally pleasing to the eye and come out with rich colour and enough detail, its just possible because of wide angle and monster 64 cam..5-In the real world, this ultra-wide lens adds an all-new way to look at frames and click pictures fitting in more space than you would be able to use a standard smartphone camera.6- fingerprint sensor captures impulse on d go .. Backcover is very shiny carbonate piece making it light weight .....Excellent monster features on d goooo!!!!!

    Well the Samsung Galaxy M31 is awesome phone. The 64 MP camera captures stunning  photos during day however you cannot zoom in 64 MP during capture. The camera quality is really awesome. Super Amoled screen is good and the quality is really amazing , it's  screen doesn't feel like you are looking at a screen. It feels like it's  a picture and your eyes never tired of it like it used to be in LCD screen. The fast charger provided is fast enough and charges at 1% per min. The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user. I'm  really happy to buy such an amazing phone.However I would like Samsung to include selfie capture just by using fingerprint  sensor , this is the only thing it is lagging and everything in One UI is amazing.

    I bought this phone for 3 reasons:- Awesome Screen- 2 Days Battery Life Yet Easy To Carry- Great Camera PerformanceI am happy to say that Samsung M31 delivers on all the above promises.What could have been better:- Newer chipset although I haven't seen any lag in any normal tasks thanks to the great optimization done by Samsung folks.- Battery charging time is a little high as the battery capacity is very hugh despite the 15W fast charging capacity.I think it would be too much to ask for anything else from a device this good at such an amazing price point.In short, if you want a device with an awesome screen, huge battery life and amazing camera - just go for the MegaMonster Samsung M31.

    Plz don't buy this phone. Just after 12 day purchase, mobile stopped working. When I visited service centre, service engineer told me that operating system has been corrupted. They update the OS and mobile starts working. Then again after 8 days mobile stopped suddenly. When I visited service centre engineer told me that this mobile has serious issues with OS. Now this time it took 1 week to update. This is ridiculous Samsung. Why New mobile has this much problem. Nobody from Samsung is responding not on mobile or not in email. This is what you called international brand. To hell with that. Plz plz don't buy this set.

    Hi, I have raised a concern already about heating up of device. When I am on call, mobile gets heated up very much and I am facing sever pain below my left ear.After stating all this over the call (I used my old mobile to call), Amazon team has asked me to do troubleshooting and diagnosed my mobile when I was not using my mobile and  the result showed under control temperature of the device. I am shocked that even I stated so many times about my physical pain, they are not ready to place a request of return/replacement.I urge you to please support here. I am not able to see any other option to return it.Going forward, I would not be ordering anything from Amazon and will also suggest my friends and family too.

    Samsung Galaxy M31 Review RatingAfter 15 days of usage. The phone is a good option for budget buyers who want to stick to a band. The battery life is good but not excellent. Performance is okayish considering it has 6MB RAM. Camera is decent enough.  Build quality is fine but you would need a protective back cover. Display is excellent and the best feature of this phone.Design: 7/10Display: 9/10Performance: 7/10Cameras: 8/10Battery: 9/10Overall: 8/10

    Phone was too good and worth for its price.. I'm writing this review after using the phone for more than a month.. till now no issues with its battery life.. I think the time period which I used is enough to make conclusion about battery and coming to screen resolution, camera quality, sound quality, performance, browsing efficiency.. everything was good till now.. the only thing I miss was earphones and protective case.. it would be very appreciative if Samsung provides earphones and protective case like how vivo is providing.. other than that no issues.. I was happy with the mobile!!!

Cameras take great photos too.One UI 2.0 is beautiful, lovely to use.Overall it has been a great purchase. Great Work, Samsung.

    Phone performance is really very good, not stacking or hanging during multiple app operation. Battery is also very good. But the camera 64MP is not up to the mark compared to oppo/vivo 48MP. But camera is good.SAR value is very low and its a very good point to buy this mobile. Overall very good mobile phone  in this budget.

    The Camera Quality is really good but I hope there could have been more options in the camera settings and the fingerprint reader is quite quick and efficient and the full HD full screen display is too good for viewing videos , shows, films etc . What is Dislike is the battery which could have been better. The battery power is said to be 6000 mah but it isn't lasting for a day sometimes . The Battery is draining a bit fast while using mobile data or Wifi ! Overall I would rate this phone 4 out of 5 stars ! Thank you for this amazing product ! The Operating system is quite good but almost similar to the previous samsung smartphones.

    Thank you Samsung for coming with this good product, and coming to the review part the major reason I needed to shift to a new phone was the battery, and while travelling this was my greatest hurdle to ensure the battery doesn’t drain out till I reach Home. Hopefully the monster 6000 Mah battery saves my day. The power packed quad camera also gives an edge over me while clicking pictures at various light condition. The biometrics is functioning smoothly and backed by a good User interface. The system is powerful and smooth and yes I loved it.

I went to manali with this phone and Pictures and vedios are of superior Quality. I love it's camera. Low light picture quality is also fine.Huge battery (6000mAh) is given with this phone. I am a heavy user and for me it works more than a day. The only issue I feel is, battery takes little long time to fully charge, but it's worth once it's charged. I am very satisfied with this phone. Just go with it. :-)

Waiting for the same- Charan

    Not better than its predecessor, M30s. Slow in face unlock. Hanging from the first day itself. 64 MP camera isn't upto the mark. It's  quality and clarity is equal to the 48 MP camera of M30s. Not happy. Finger print sensor is not responding sometimes. 6000 mAh Battery is only for numbers. Isn't lasting even for one day with moderate usage. Totally disappointed.

    Pros:1. Excellent display quality.2. Decent battery life.3. User friendly UI with lag free experience.4. Phone is not too heavy considering the battery capacity.Cons:1. Photos from Selfie come out to be soft in indoor lighting condition, Even after disabling the beauty mode the camera tries to smoothen the skin tone, I hope a software update for front facing camera can fix it.2. Photos from macro camera seems average.3. Overall I would say this phone's camera needs software optimization.

    I like the smoothness on the phone, it's camera is really good, the zoom allows the picture not to get pixelated even if you zoom in a lot. The fingerprint gesture and the face recognition is quite fast in comparison to other phones. Battery life is good. However,  the phone gets heated up at times and becomes difficult to take a call and placing on the ear when it's heated up. Also, the phone automatically restarts in between, maybe once every 3-4 days. Overall, this is a good phone for this price!

    I bought this product last week through Amazon. The camera is of high clarity and overall it is a really good phone. But there is something wrong with the mobile's microphone. During a call I end up sounding muffled or far off to the person on the other end even if I am using an earphone. It is really turning out to be a major issue due to the high strain with which I have to speak. I am thinking about returning back the product. Plus the battery too is running out a bit fast. Other than that the product is great and handy.

Options provided in pro mode is very nice & useful, selfi Camara also playing very nice role. It is also quick in unlocking phone by face recognition.Battery life is fo far good, I was expected battery will  comes around 2 days but getting around 1.5 can't say it is bad. Optimizing the apps may give more efficiency.

    I bought it on the first day of the sale itself. Have been using it for one week.  Camera quality's excellent , a notch above competition. Same goes about tge display as well. SAmoled screen's very vivid and crystal clear, especially with fhd videos. Battery can easily push 30-36 hrs even if u use it extensively. Not a gamer. So cant review about processer.However the only one issue i noticed is the mobile data/ wifi may become unresponsive/ idle. We will have to turn off wifi/ toggle flight mode to solve it.

    Ordered 6GB  variant at 1200 on 05th Mar 2020 and received mobile on the same day evening 0830 pm.This is my first Samsung phone. Using this for 5 days and it would be best one in Mid range phones. Massive battery and 128GB is huge storage space. All applications and games are running smoothly. Yet to try COD and PUBg. Played Asphalt 9 and it was so smooth. Front camera was superb in video calls.Worth mobile to buy.

    I was waiting for 3 years for the right phone. Right price. Best of features in a midrange segment.Really happy to have found the right phone.Great camera.Being a doctor-long battery life really supports my work schedule.apart from the backside being a fingerprint magnet for my oily hands\"no backcover provided with the pack\"..its really handy!superamoled display is just lit!and a lightning fast delivery by amazon prime.

    For this price, there cant be a better phone. The fingerprint reader is a little slow, but overall, this phone can't be better. The Ram and storage is more than perfect, I can go hours playing PUBG or COD, with no lagging. And the camera, i compared my M31's camera to my friend's iPhone 11 pro max, and our friends couldn't make out the difference, so you know your camera is best, when it's being compared to a 1 lakh INR phone

    The phone is quite good. Its Fast as it have a 6 GB Ram. It have an Amazing Battery life of 6000 mAh which last for  a full day without charging while playing games and doing stuffs. It has a good camera 64 MP and a good video recording at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30fps. The bad thing in this mobile is that it don’t not come with an earphones while having an earphone jack. That very disappointing. Overall it is a MegaMoster.

    1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

    Worst mobile was I got , Samsung m31 taking more time for charging 100% , it's almost 4 hours for charging , and after that 20 hours battery I'll train 0% its waste of time compare to other fast charging mobile , and camera worst

    Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just <U+20B9>59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

    hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

    I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

    The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.

    Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.

    Received the phone 10 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re preinstalled, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.

    Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.

    Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.

    Everything is okey except below:1) Camera is getting blurry when you fully zoom for long distance images. It should not happen if its 64MP and one of its USP2) Speaker volume is very Low3) Can not split display while you are already on another app4) Can not connect internet through WPS5) Poor in facelock sensor6) Palm swipe to capture screen shot is not working always.. It should be 100% accurate then only it works..Rest all superb with this price

    Excellent product. Worth buying it.Pros:Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.Excellent front cam.Blue color looks stunning.S amoled screen with always on display.Finger print and face unlock work superb.Android 10.Cons:Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.Suggestions:Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.

    Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.

Smooth and buttery experience.Display(Super Amoled FHD+)is gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic and color reproduction is amazing.Processor(Exynos 9611) is quite powerful.

    Worst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software. Now phone is locked for more than 2days in a screen showing AVB error . I tried to restart phone many time but still showing same . Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march. Lockdown nation wide still on can't go to Samsung care centre. I'm giving those stars because I don't have any option for zero.I don't understand what should I do.

    After a months use I will highly recommend this phone to all heavy users. The camera and battery are two of the best pros to buy this mega monster. Screen is awesome and clearly visible in bright sunlight. One very important benefit is that when you connect the phone to computer for taking photos or files from your phone, its very easy to find the files or photos from phone memory, whereas its a nightmare to find your data on most of the Chinese brands. Its the best option out there, so dont try any other Chinese phones but buy Samsung Galaxy M31.

    I never had a bad experience but this is the bad choice , I choosed to buy samsung m31 phone. Bad experience. Main problem is too badly got heat back camera part and when you will make a call same back portion will vibrant. And also company given 6gb ram when you play online games , games will lack too badly. Maybe companies fault . Lots friends said after samsung is not a. Good phone for roughly use. This is ladies phone. Really I am agry for this. I got lots of problems. Even I didn't go for return coz from the next day lockdown also started.

    Almost everything is perfect!• The \"best part\" of it is its battery which lasts for almost 10 hours of heavy usage. Mediocre usage will last for like 1.5 days, ideal for long train journeys!• The camera quality is very good.• It stutters sometimes while heavy usage.• Google Due video calling was a bit laggy.• Don't know about gaming performance as I don't use it for gaming purpose.• 128GB feels like you don't need any storage device anymore. It's like you have your work related each and every thing in your pocket.• Experience of viewing videos at night in an amOLED screen is blissfull.

    Nice phone with almost all advanced features.Pros:-1. Display is FHD and full marks to it.2. Sound quality is ok.3. Android 10 is handy.4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.Cons:-1. Battery is never felt like 6000mah. Rather it performs like 4500mah.2.while receiving the call the panel sensitivity is poor.Overall value for money. Must buy.

    Really amazing phone  after 4days of use . Samsung is best in battery 6000 mah .  every  time I use to carry power bank for charging.  Now no tension , no power bank, and no charger.Comes to display : really I am very  happy  for dispay  with low budget I got amoled display.Next comes memory and ram: I bought  6 GB and 128 gb store and with expanded memory  slot.For this specification: other phones are 18k +Any way  again Samsung  is mobile ka THALAIVA

    *** What i liked in this device:-+ Large Display of 6.44 Inch which is Super AMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Displa+ Camera (64MP f/1.8 Samsung GW1 Sensor, 8MP Ultra Wide-Angle Lens, 5MP Depth Sensor & 5MP Macro Sensor)+ 6000 mAh Massive Battery+ Massive storage with decent LPDDR4x RAM (6GB Ram / 128GB)+ Expandable Storage via Micro SD Card Upto 512GB.+ OneUI 2.0+ Fast fingerprint sensor and face unlock*** What i disliked:-- Charging Speed, huge 6000mAh battery the 15W fast charging feels too slow.- Earphones were a great deal to get inside the box { missing the time when it was included with samsung phones }*** Additional:-* Camera quality is great both with pictures as well as videos but could be bit more better.* No lags so far even with a very heavy use* Battery remains even after whole day of heavy use

    This mobile is one of the best in its price range. Firstly, the battery is rock solid. At 6000 mah, it comes for more than one and a half day's usage for a hard user like me. The display is kickass and the other features like finger print sensor and face recognition works fast too. On the design front, M31 looks like an identical twin of M30s except for the camera module which houses 4 lenses.The quad cam is good for daylight shooting. In the night, it does feel that Samsung could've done better. But again, considering the price range and other features packed in the phone, its forgivable, I would say. The charging is quite slow because of the 6000 mah battery.This is my third day with the phone and wrt to the first impression, I can say that this phone is a winner. If your are planning to buy one, I would recommend you to buy the 128 GB version. Hardly 1000 bucks more than the 64 GB version. But with the amount of photos and videos you are gonna shoot with this superb camera, I am sure you would want to have more memory.

    Value for money: Truly a value for money phone, as in this range you are getting everything you need.Handiness: Great confidence on hold, I have always used phones without back covers and tempered glass. When I was buying this phone was thinking how will I manage this big phone but I was surprised as it is not slippery with a glass-like material which keeps your look on.Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range.Battery: It is fine, stays for 1.5 or 2 days was expecting it will last for more time but it is fine as there are many services which are continuously running so it's fine. And I was thinking that with 6000 mah battery it will be heavy but it's not as compared to other phones.Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.

    Pros:Good Battery life. After 100% charging I watched 5 movies (Indian) and used mobile data during my train journey. Battery lasted for 1.5 days.Width: Width of screen compared to My old Redmi Note 3 is less and hence was easy to hold on.I brought this phone for Battery and speed and I am totally satisfied.Cons: In Sunlight brightness is not that g8t. My old Redmi Note phone I was able to watch videos without any issue.

Had no problems running games like PUBG in high graphics.Excellent battery life. Currently writing this review I haven't charged the phone for 2 days and still have around 40% charge despite using it frequently.The music quality while using headphones is amazing, especially due to Dolby Atmos.Cons:Sound quality from the phone speaker could be better.A lot of pre-installed apps was not to my liking, though a few could be uninstalled.The icons look generic and all the good themes have to be bought through the Samsung store, or you can use other launchers.

    I'm reviewing this product after using for a week..It is absolutely an beast in this price segment..One thing about Samsung is that..Its super amoled display,security and build  ...-SOFTWARE:8.5/10The new OneUI 2.0 built on Android 10 is superb and user friendly..Also it has some good features-DISPLAY:9/10The 6.4inch amoled display  with full-HD+ is good...It supports Widevine L1 to which is awesome..The details were richer compared to other mobiles in this price segment-BATTERY:10/10The massive 6000mah is pretty good and it lasts upto 1.5 days for a normal user .Charging from 0-75% is good with 15W charger but after it takes a long time to reach 100% ..Total time taken (0-100%) is 2.5 hrs..-SOUND:9/10The sound is decent..it has richer tone and no distortion at high volumes...The Dolby Atmos supports only with Earphones  but it was excellent. Call quality was good..-CAMERA:7.5/10As this model is just an upgraded version of m30s,it is just have been improved...The pics came out well in daylight..dynamic range was pretty decent....But video stabilization and photos at low light was not upto the mark..Macro was okayish...The front camera was okay ..But overall good..-It is not suitable  for high graphics  gaming...Overheating is not there...I suggest Samsung  to upgrade  the chipset in the future-Fingerprint reader is very fast-Phone is slippery..I suggest you to buy a good case for it.

    I am old user of samsung mobile and i am big fan of samsung display...so for display 5 out of 5 stars...For camara : i can give 4.5 out of 5 stars...-0.5 because of Samsung captures some high saturated picture.so same for m31 also.For battery life : 5 out of 5 stars...coz you can go for 1 full day with 6000 mah battery..For charger : it takes 2 to 2.5 h to get full charge so charger is fast but not so fast.For performance: 4.5 out of 5 stars as per performance...i am using m31 from last aprox 20 days...i didnt notice any single lag in this phone...-0.5 coz of gaming performance...m31 is good but not that much...But overall you can surely go for it...this is my genuine opinion on m31...Budget phone with extra budget facilities...i m satisfied with my purchase...Thank youGood product with good price

    Should be fine for an average user. I dont think this phone can handle heavy gaming. The only game I play on this phone is coin master and I've seen that game not load or just close on its own like 5 times in the 2 weeks I've owned this phone. Camera isn't that good. Display is ok. But its the large battery that is the only reason I bought the phone, and it does last long. Light gaming, YouTube, instagram, twitter, and other daily tasks is no problem for battery life. You can easily see 9+ hours of screen on time, I've seen as high as 11+. I was glad to see there is no idle battery drain. I go to sleep with the battery at 90% and when I wake up in the morning the battery is still at 90% or sometimes 89%. Which is great.

    Before m31 I have m30s  which is one of the best smartphone coming up at that range. Now as the upgradation move on m31. The camera quality with quad 64 MP rear camera comes with different modes is amazing and spiced up with Bixby vision you can click pictures that hard to differentiate from HD wallpapers. With the 6000 mAh battery can endures your smartphone processes for as long as 1 day of continuous activity (non gaming) Fingerprint is perfectly sensitive and better than compare to m30s. 6 GB RAM can provide perfect speed throughout the running apps. Best part about it sAmoled screen is one of the best features that make it different from other phones the colour quality because of that is completely amazing and on top of that while comparing it to iPhone 8 screen for sure samsung going to win over.

    I did a lot of research before i bought this phone. 1.First of all, the battery life is absolutely amazing, a heavy user like me is not able to kill battery in a day.2. The camera quality is quite decent. Although expected more , but for this price range it is pretty gud.3.The display is top notch , its quite gud and colorful.4. The fingerprint scanner has absolutely no time lag. It is very well made.5. The performance is quite gud. Although, samsung Exynos was used. There was many critics who wished for Snapdragon,  but for daily use it runs well.The only problem i hv come across is heating. Its not over heating, just little increase in temperature.  This happens only while playing high spec games like PUGB. It is not problem , just mentioned it just in case.Overall, for people who are looking for a decent gaming and daily use phone. This Samsung Galaxy M31 is my recommendation to you.

    I got the delivery of phone on 6 March.When you first boot up the phone you will get update for February security patch.This phone comes with One Ui 2.0 & the first best part of is you can delete preloaded apps. This ui is more snappy & feels like a premium phone even though it's a midrange phone.Pros :-1) Super amoled display with L1 certification2) UI is more responsive & can be customizable as per our need which basically give a feel of stock android.3) Battery Backup is killer you can do the excessive task on this phone.4)Ram Management is on point.Cons :-1) Photos of night atmosphere are not good.2) Speaker of the phone is ok.3) Placement of headphone Jack.4) Slow Charging speed & length of the USB cable is too short.Though, Samsung gives good package of software's like Dolby atmos, MrOwl for unlimited cloud storage.

    I was tempted to write a review a few weeks after I bought this phone. I have been MI phone before. With some research and my requirements I bought this. I'm not disaapointed.What is good about this phone? The camera is superb. The battery is superb. But what I like the most is the display. With MI phones in the same prize range, the display of Galaxy M31 is much much better.Cons:Less OS features. Many of the software features are found missing in this phone. For example, short cut for taking screen shot doesn't work as desired. Facial recognition is a tat slow.Overall: 4.5 out of 5

    Looked up many reviews  and purchased Samsung M31 as I was convinced that this is the phone with the most robust battery. Nothing else matters at the end of the day if you don't have  enough charge left. So this phone really fit pls the bill. The photos are crystal clear and the the 4 cameras at the back give you several options for the same.But this phone, shut off the unnecessary notifications,  put a slick black screen to help save your power.The wide Amulet display makes watching movies and ott platforms a pleasure.The sound from.the speakers are good and equally great on the headphone. Turn on the Dolby atmos if you have to giving you options for music, movies or sports. A great value for money at around 16000 rupees.

    I am using M31 (6GB,128GB), the performance is good but there is some problems:1. Experience Heating problem, while playing heavy game like PUBG for more than 1 hour on the upper part of the phone.2. Sometimes freezing of samsung keyboard.3. Gyroscope is not much Sensitive as compare to other brand phones.At last phone is good, not better choice for gamers.

Some apps crashed.So happy to have a good camera smartphone but I believe it can be better with the 15k budget.

    Bought it on the launch hour. I am rating this after using it for more than two weeks. It is worth your money. I think, Samsung cameback  with a bang. Awesome  speck in this range. Don't waste your money choosing other vendors.Both sides  Camera's are stunning.Sound quality is very good.Battery backup is coming for 2 days.Initially felt bit heavy ..but now I am okay with it.No lags at all. Just go for it...

Sound system is upto the mark5. Battery: if you are using continuously, the battery would work upto 1 day.Con: Only issues that I am facing is,while using WhatsApp, in middle of a conversation, phone is hanging for 2 mins with no reason. Not sure, what's the problem is but it happend to me many times with in this short time.I request Samsungs to overcome this issue in the next update.

I did a factory reset but the problem has not solved, now right side touch works intermittently and the left side is not working at all. it has no damage on display but its not working.

There are many things that I like one is the super amoled display the battery and pubg for 6h a day it supports the highest graphics setting in pubg and smooth experience in day to day use . I think its the best phone in this budget segment. Not only this how can I forget the camera which is fantastic the wide angle shots and the 64 mp main shooter it amazing the picture didn't need and editing.  I am using this device since it was launched and now it is 2 weeks no issue at all . I hope you will like my review and suggest this  phone to you

    I bought SAMSUNG GALAXY M31  SPACE BLACK  6/64 about a week ago. It was good and performance also good but the fingerprint sensor not reading properly. I am getting little trouble with it. Have to clean properly every time. And the camera at this price is too high. Mostly battery life, Mega Monster for a reason. You can't get a mobile with this features at this price. And I love the design of it, light weight cool looks don't even need a back cover the glass was soo hard and smooth. Quality of the sound is good when playing music. The DOLBY ATMOS working perfectly when you use earphones. Totally satisfied with this.

From my perspective the device is to good for customer as this device provide all the features like 64MP(main camera) + 8MP(depth camera) + 5MP(macro camera) + 5MP(wide-angle camera), all useful sensor's,  long lasting battery backup and sAmoled display.

Camera is not great. 64 MP photo shots - after binding it has too much noise.2. Macro camera shot - focus of the object is not proper ,hope there ll be software update.3. Battery back up - one full charge lasts for only 12hr with normal usage.

    Ordered my new Galaxy M31 last week. The first impression was good.  Build quality  looks premium, though metallic body would have been great. Quite fast to operate. Excellent  bright display. Camera clicks good quality photos. Macro cam is gives moderate  quality  clicks. Battery lasts longer and recharge doesnt take unusually  long time.Overall happy with my choice. At this price point,  it is one of the best device  available in market.

And having so many customization to do.Overall I can say is at this price range is awesome. You must go for this device. Also from Samsung a brand you can fully relay on.

    Working very nice... looks very good. It's sensor is so good that it feels like butter touch. The price is worth purchasing.. Samsung is giving you a lot in this price like Android 10, Gorilla glass, 6000 mAh Li-ion battery, crystal clear dolby sound , battery back up is very good, Ocean Blue looks attractive, but its C -type charging cable should have been a little longer in size. So, I  recommend yo buy it because Samsung is giving much more than the other products available at the se price in market.

    Good looking mobile. Nice camera but disappointed in night vision and natural colors. Sharpness is low. Battery backup according to 6000mah is average in normal usage( 3-4calling & 1-2hr internet maximum 36hr.. Fast charger is taking  more than 100mins for 20 to 100 .Call on speaker not working properly.Display quality is very good. Selfie camera is good. Overall in this budget phone is good but not very good

    Phone is getting heated. Network delay is there. It's taking a very long time for a call to get connected. Once a call is connected there is nearly a delay of 5 seconds in hearing the opposite parties voice. People are complaining that my voice is continuously breaking when I am speaking from this phone and the opposite parties voice is also continuously breaking and I couldn't hear them properly. Apart from this the other features of this phone and it's appearance are all very good.

    I purchased 02 x Samsung galaxy m31 mobiles, one is ocean blue and another is space black.The phone is excellent in all performance, I never saw  this type of mobile of any company at this price to collision to this phone.Brilliant in all. Quality camera, battery, lovely LED display, software performance, excellent memory, excellent processor, and all.I think it is the best mobile in India in 2020.  The brand SAMSUNG.  Love it.

    The phone looks promising in terms of features at the price it is offered at.cons:1. Battery is not living upto the expectation which was claimed by manufacturer.2 the sound output from speaker is less which becomes difficult to listen in noisy environments.3. In screen fingerprint  scanner is something sported by all other phone manufacturers should have been incorporated.

    Do not see the negative  comments and withdraw your decession  on buying this phone this is a good phone in this price segment and the cameras are good too better than note 8 pro in almost every aspect and also in terms of ui highly  recommended product for heavy users .but not recommended for  heavy games who wish to play 6-7 hours of pubg. Excellent  phone for daily usage and media consumption go for it.one of the best phone under 15k

    Phone is not recommendedDuring calls I am facing few issues  like call recording will start automatically or call will go on hold. These could be due to sensitivity  issues and placement of additional menu close to face touch. Never faced these  issues  in my prior  mobiles.

    This is the best device under 15k range. I have purchased 64Gb space black device. Fingerprint scanner is really very smooth it unlocks device very fast. Camera set is really very good you can take the best quality pictures from rear and front camera as well. If you will trun of the animation from the device the battery life is also very good. Highly satisfied with the device.

    At this price range it's good buy. Back panel should have been more scratch resistant. Or else Samsung should have provided a basic back panel , and why there are no ear phones ( for15999) , Samsung could have provided one.Other than that every thing seems good as of now, will update after 1 month use.

We are feeling  helpless as don't have any other similar charger to charge the mobile even don't have any backup phone as well. As it's lockdown situation and unable to seek any backup. Phone is switched off from today morning. Pathetic product from Samsung.

    Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

    I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes. I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me.

    I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

    Very bad mobile. Heating and hanging problem. Amazon not refunding even having mobile problem. Don't buy this mobile. Go for Redmi mobile. Camera  quality is  worst. Many thing's not  supported. Anyone want to take this mobile please let me know. Reduce some amount. Buy before 7 days. Only  battery is good other is worst. Samsung  must quit in making mobile.

    Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardwareFinally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.Infact my first samsung phone.While configuration, received security patch and UI updatesFrom user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefullySuper happy user since 3days. No complaints or regret on buying the phone.

    Camera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good . Phone heats up a little bit but that heating is acceptable .Screen is not as good as Nokia screens and others (IPS LCD ) , IPS LCD would have given a better performance .Screen doesn't give Natural colours.Performance is good . Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .The software has better options .Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .Charging cable is too short .Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome

    It's an upgrade to the M30s. The screen is good with a raindrop camera. The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.For Gamers there a Game Booster App.The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.Cons:The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.

    Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am <U+0001F4AF> percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,

    Amoled display very Sharp and vivid.Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.OS is smooth.CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.Finger print reader is fast.Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)Best phone offered by Samsung....go for it<U+0001F44C>

But i am using the face recognition. I feel its better . I tried using my photos to unlock the phone .... No luck ... Works only with my face...Camera quality is good .... From a layman's perspective these are gr8 . From a photographer perspective they are just good. Depth camera gives good bokeh...Macro camera is goodBattery Life is just amazing ... I use this with all office communication apps and still get more than 2 days out of it ... Seriously i am just way toooo happy with it.Not happy with below:Phone is a little heavy because of monster batteryKnox is replaced with McAfeeI even tried some games like pubg and call of duty ... Seem to work fine for me ... So overall a monster (excellent) Phone

    A complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...

    I have a Samsung M31SYMPTOMSa) all videos regardless of the application used are playing on fastforward with no sound. This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK1. Restart multiple times2. Reset app preferences3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)

    OMG!!!Fabulous one!I just love this one. Samsung just has brought a best phone for us under 20k.Since, I've been using this product, I found it better than any other phone in market. The most impressive  thing I find is it's UI, battery, camera and smooth screen(higher refresh rates). It's camera is really fabulous one. The battery of this phone do never let you down from using. It's UI is too user friendly. I found it best in every aspect. It's terrible combination of it's price and features makes me mad. Guys, I solemnly recommend you to have purchase of this product.thanks!Hopefully, I think you find this review helpful.#SAMSUNG #SAMSUNGM31 #M31#GOMONSTER

    Great display for the price range and I am happy that I shifted to Samsung for this reason.Battery life is good and lasts for almost 2 days with normal usage with WiFi, but it's not the best as it drains quickly with 4G.Camera is decent when it's outdoor. At low light and indoors it's just an average camera. Live focus selfies and night mode(front and rear)are useless. Live focus / portrait blurs out some portion of the face which is very bad.Call quality and speaker quality is fine.Samsung One UI is good but it misses out some of the important features as it's M series phone.

    I haven't come across such a great camera at this cost. Battery is just keep going until you get off...optimal size & screen details are amazing..over all, ...fingerprint sencer at back & follow your commands instantly without any glitch  ..never ending battery I experienced..using it for more than month now...it's get on well with me...screen size is nothing but perfect what I looking for & the phone is much convenient in holding it ...no second thought if you desperately need a phone ...a complete package to complete a man!!!!!

    I really like the camera. The battery life was very good .It took me around 2 days to completely discharge the battery.The amoled screen was like cherry on the top of cake .They only complain I have is there is a minor lag in viewing the picture after taking a snap .It takes a pause of 2-3 sec which was bit unusual for me because  the phone performance was very good and  It is very fast . The other thing is there is no stabilization in macro mode and the night mode is pretty good  (it's  not very good ).Ignoring these minor defects  ...the phone is all in all very good .I'm satisfied  with it.The delivery by Amazon was fast and the phone was neatly  packed .

    DISLIKES:I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product  Defects:No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:-headphone audioJack not working-caller audio receiver not working-speaker not workingVideos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2× speed.Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.LIKES:Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.WHO can Buy:-Camera is priority-Wants some bigger battery-day to day regular usage-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wiselyPHONE WONT' SATISFY:-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.-onscreen finger print sensor-A51Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.For this price,this is a real mega monster.REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer's<U+0001F601>

    UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(

    I have moved down from note 8 which i bought for 64 thousand 2 years back, from amazon. I purchased this for 16 thousand. I was expecting a major downgrade but i am happy to share that the user experience is just as good. The battery impresse me and i am astounded that samsung delivered the same screen quality that i had on the note 8. Camera is decent but i am comparing it to a note so my expectations are high. The weight distribution is so good that it feels much better to hold than to hold a note 8. I have used it tocplay call of duty mobile and it works well with medium settings.I dont think you can get better value for money at this price and that too with service support of a behemoth like samsung.

    Handson experience after 10 days.Really disappointing product from Samsung. This is utlra hyped product. Its a marketing stratagy of samsung to promote it. Only battery is the feature of the phone which last around 1.5 days on heavy usage. i am a game freak and it is good for that.The camera is pathetic mark my word pathetic its a 8 megapixel camera which they branding as 64 megapixel. when you zoom after cl8cking a photo there is no details. its all blurred out and you feel cheated like anything. the selfie camera sucks. Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone. Be aware before you buy. 2 star is only for battrry only battrry.

    After so much of research, I decided to go with M31 on the second day of launch. To my surprise, the phone matched my Expectations. Have to appreciate Amazon for the super fast delivery, I ordered it by night around 10pm and I got the phone delivered by next day morning 9am. Packing was good and safe.I'm writing this mobile review based on my first 2 days experience with this phone. Will add later if there is anything.Pros:1. Very nice battery. It was coming roughly 2 days for a moderate usage in 4G.2. Camera is very decent. Even though it doesn't justify 64mp, still I would say camera is good with clear pictures.3. Display is too good4. Phone is not very heavy and good to use5. Voice clarity and signal is good6. Looks very good and stylish too.Cons:1. Finger print is placed very high in the back, needs to stretch a bit to reach the sensor2. Charging is very slow(I understand its 6000mah), roughly 2.5hrs, could have given charger with more watts.3. Charging cable length is very short4. No earphones provided with this mobile.5. Speaker is not much loud as only one speaker is provided at the bottom6. Has mild heat when we play high end games, but its not too heat alsoOverall is a Good budget phone to buy.

    Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.

    Battery backup not very good. And i am facing frequent issues with network connectivity and also with sound.. I have to restart now and then to get it working again. Slight heating issue is also there. Overall, i am disappointed with the mobile. I dont know if these issues are in my handset only or is a model defect. Camera is just nice only and not great as i expected from a 64 mp camera. Screen display quality is good and touchscreen is very responsive though.

    I bought this phone because of the brand name \"samsung\". The first touch phone which I was used is Samsung(sliding type with touch). When I saw the add of this m31 I fixed this in mind.  This phone is one of the most fantastic phone which I have ever seen. There is no words to say about The Batery life. It is Amazing. I can watch continuously 6 movies from 100%. Still the charge is 50% only . Even in my nonstop use I am getting 2.5 days battery life. Camera quality is also an amazing thing. Video quality  is like a Digital camera video. Photos are getting more and more clear during zooming.  Camera clarity is supeeeeerrr..Fingerprint reader is excellent . It is too fast in unlocking using finger.Ram is also fabulous.  No hang or delay. Sound quality is also super.  From my point of view I have no negatives to say. This is an excellent phone . A huge facility in an affordable budget. I suggested this phone to 2 of my friends and the purchased too... so dear friends  pls choose this phone, u will not get this much features in any other phone. Others may have more features but they have no battery life and maximum 6 hrs back up. They have no brand value also. A small battery with more load can't use for more time. But our samsung is king. Pls try once u loved it u will not change ur mind.  Still I am fall in love with samsung. Especially the battery life... thank you samsung team for giving this gift to us. ........

    I changed to Samsung M31 from One Plus 3, which I was using for 3.5+ years. This phone was a major upgrade for me. Quad- camera, super Amoled screen and humongous battery are the super cons of the phone. Being a non-gamer, I have no issues with the performance. But, overall the phone is absolute value for money. I would like to add a few cons, which I think should be taken into consideration while buying this:1. No dash charging. Having used One Plus for quite a long, charging the phone becomes a bit painful for me. It takes close to 3 hrs to fully charged from zero. But, having a 6000 mah battery, it takes a lot to time to get drained as well. I was able to use this phone more than 24 hours on a single charge with quite heavy usage and screen time.2. The speaker could have been a bit louder. It's not bad, but could have been better.3. The phone is not meant for heavy gamers.4. Camera UI could be improved a lot and could me made more clean and clutter-free.

    I'll start by saying this is the best Birthday gift I have purchased for myself, also my First Samsung phone.I will start with the my experience with the phone so far.Speed:- Great speed and touch response and Apps opening time is amazing- Phone boot up is quite fast- Fingerprint and face ID is very fast compared to In-display fingerprint- Gaming experience is good tooCamera:- Attached the shots, see the amazing close up and night mode- Super amoled display shows the  best possible colors- Steady camera, till not I haven't got a single blur picture or out of focus, which is amazing- Image process is impressive, no time delay in capturing and saving the imagesLooks:Trust if if anything matters the most to me is the looks of the phone, this phone looks amazing and quite attractiveOne small issue - a bit slippery, but a cover would take care of it. I'm not a cover fan though, I like the phone the way it is.Features:Fast ChargingAndroid 10 One UI2Memory Card slotBest - 3.5 mm Audio JackDolby Atmos sound6000 mAh - more than 48 hours with moderate usage and about day and half with extreme usageCharting time is about 30-45 minutesNO ADs - The best partSound: Quite loud, over calls as well on speaker side. That's what I loveTo be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.Assistant is also quite nice.For me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segmentSamsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.The only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.Also the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.I'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product. Thanks

    I am writing this review after 10 days.1.CAMERAI found the rare camera excellent. The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.when we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.2.BATTERYThe 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.3.DISPLAYPerfect, no problem with that.4.VALUE FOR MONEYthe best from devices in this price segment.5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCKfinger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that. Face unlock is very fast during a day. But doesn't work sometimes at night and artificial light sources.PROS1.BIG BATTERY2.AWESOME DISPLAY3.GREAT CAMERA4.FAST FINGER PRINT SCANNERCONS1.LACKS FOCUS ON THE MACRO MODE CAMERA2.THE PHONE HEATS SOMETIMES BUT MANAGABLE.3.FRONT CAMERA IS NOT SOO GOOD AT NIGHT TIME.3.FELLS A LAG ON SLOWMOTION VIDEOS

    This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage.Good:- Display was good with Blue light filter.- Performance is good for now. No heating or lagging.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.- Mobile speakers sound is fine.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.Not So Good:Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

    After using this mobile for two days now im comfortable to write the review.Pros1.Strong battery back up(i got 16 hours backup without playing games but i was continuously using internet)2.camera is way better3.Screen experience is too good.4.UI5.No heating effect while charging the phone6. Dual 4g7.No lagging in apps as they have provided  6gb RAM8.128 GB ROM which is enough9. Big batteryCONSBiggest issue is about network.Netowrk is not consistent through out so be aware of this.1.Fingerprint sensor on back side.It should be on screen or it should be imposed on lock key2.Material finishing looks cheaper they have used plastic as compared with other brands.3.Charger should be 30W but m31 is with 15w charger as it takes time to charge4.In the same price range other brands are giving fastest cpu where as samsung is giving middle class processor to samsung is giving its processor5.As it is 10nm technology  it reduces battery stand by time while other brands uses 8nm which saves the battery.6.Charger and mobile design need to be changed.

    Mobile features justifies with its name that is mega monster.Pros.1. Battery life- as I'm using mobile from last 7 days it's battery life is beyond my expectations. I'm heavy user and battery running life is arround 48 hours.2. Camera- four different cameras works in very good manner. Picture quality is excellent. When i zoom the picture it don't make blurred pixels.Front camera is also doing it's duty strongly.Mobile with latest features are excellentFew of them are pop up screen, side button uses, good adoption of fingerprint sensor.And the best thing is its super amoled display makes this mobile very attractive.Cons.If i talk about mobile cons there is only one what i get is- facelock feature is not working as good as i expected.Rest choice is yours, but after using this mobile i have recommended my friends to buy this mobile, and give you suggestion the same.In it's price segment it's really mega monster.

    Software isn't  as sturdy as needed, seems slower at most of the times.Camera is good, but not as good as claimed. Even 6/10 as claimed.Battery charges fast enough and gives good back up.Fingerprint sensor is ok only, while as face recognition isn't even ok.Overnight downloading stops by itself and you need to manually turn on/off the data to keep up the downloading. Checked all the settings but the issue persists.I guess, Phone's software needs some sort of upgrade and the phone will be perfect among all other phones of under 20k range.

    Why are some of the reviews mentioning poor camera etc? There is nothing much wrong with this phone. It is a good product and should be a smooth companion for an year at least.P.S> I don't play games on my phone. I wanted a great display (AMOLED), decent performance, good camera and a reasonably decent battery life. I got what I wanted and if you want the same, go for it too. Do buy a good case along with the phone because Samsung has not given a case inside the box.

    Well no doubt indeed it was one of the most awaited mobile phone of 2020 and I must say It was worth it ,6000 mah battery , 64mp camera and many more cool and latest featuresBut there was one minute areas where I believe the creature should have taken care of  - length of data cableNo doubt the charger is a fast charger still it would have been appropriate if the length of cable was bit longerLast but not the least as a Samsung user I never get tired of bragging the level of service you provide us at your service centre ..pls keep it like this always<U+0001F9E1>

Battery is really what I was looking for. If you just travel for a couple of days, you really don't need to battery charge. Thanks for a giant battery.Thanks to seller and Amazon for providing best service and products.

    The specs is incredible on paper and when I bought it and actually tested it, most of the specs hold good. The camera quality and features are very good though it may take some time to focus on the object dynamically. Normal without zoom 64MP shots are amazing and so is Macro & ultra wide. Though when zoomed the quality goes down drastically. Charging speed and battery life are decent enough and haven't seen heating issue until now. The number 6000mah maybe bloated up but the battery performance is good enough for a common user. The AMOLED display, security features and Samsung apps/shop/members are top notch! Overall, the best common use phone you can get for this price.PS: the metal back of the phone is amazing!

    You can just tap the finger to register your print and the phone unlocks lightning fast.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M31 on the rear packs a 64-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture; a second 8-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture; a third 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a fourth 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.4 aperture. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 32-megapixel camera on the front for selfies, with an f/2.0 aperture.This phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery.

    An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within one day of placing the order. The M31 has a pretty interesting four camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days. This is the main advantageI am very much impressed with Samsung M31 by its look and design.By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS. The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.

    Frankly, I like its battery, RAM, and the color variant. I am a big fan of samsung mobiles. What I dislike is personal. I am bored of using same buttons in settings. Else no major flaw. I searched 6000 MAH battery but only samsung gave me the choice. Only for a change one can replace samsung otherwise it is the best. Good feature is cartoon characters replaces your face in AR emoji I enjoyed it. Palm selfie feature us awesome as usual. I am not camera frenzy although when we took pics others were envious because all others cameras were at flaw and samsung M31 is winner. They my friends deleted my pics in jealousy :-) I am loving it more day in day out

    This an amazing phone at this price point. I have been using iPhone 7 and Samsung galaxy s7 edge. This phone is as advanced and as a matter of fact has even more features (maybe because of the newer android os)The screen is big and has a very good resolution. The camera quality is good as such did not find much difference from other phones except for the clarity of pictures.There is absolutely no lag in performance.The best part being the battery life which is superb. I am a heavy user and the phone battery lasts for 2 days.To sum up: more than value for money.

As we compare to other 64 mp available mobile brands.\"Worst battery \".  The battery life of 6000 mah could not reach my expectations little bit.it acts as 3000 mah battery In m31 mobile, When I charged 100%,  it is decreasing within 10 hours. Without using to watch videos or playing games. Means, should have to charge again. Finally am not satisfied with the this battery.

    I bought this mobile for my father recently. First thing I like about this phone is the camera, it's pretty good.  Love the camera clarity and capability to capture minute details. Coming to the screen, I like the smoothness and big full screen. Screen clarity is on par with the high resolution prominent mobiles. It never gets stuck and really smooth. I'm happy that I picked this phone as a gift for dad. It's his first smartphone and slowly learning using the smart phone, this phone is really smooth and its makes him excited to explore this phone.

    Before buying my new smartphone, I came across many products like Mi redmi note 8 pro. But It doesn't come amoled display and huge battery life. Apart from this, I would like to appreciate the performance of mobile during game time. Also, One UI 2 which is currently Samsung's latest UI version is also have best gestures and looks and it's easy to navigate through the apps. Last but not least, Camera including rear and front are just awesome with brilliant night photos and for the portrait ones.

    Best phone in this price level.  Overall performances are very good except camera.  Camera is far better than M30&M30S but could be a little more better.  You can't use flash in 65MP and UHD resolution doesn't support video features. Apart from these..camera is fine.  Nice shots can be made easily with this one. Battery is the best part of the phone. No lag noticed in 4 days of use.  Sometimes heats up a little.. but it's negligible heating.

    Camera quality is too good for the price you pay. Enough storage space for many apps and games. Netflix and Prime is available in HD. Fingerprint reader is very fast. Battery life lasts for 1 day and next day half . Fast charger is there but it is better for overnight charging. Colour options are less but it is a great phone for price quality. The screen resolution is very good and night mode is there. Also blue light filter is also there which is very good.

Even if you zoom the photo taken by front am, to the fullest, pixels are pretty clear, no blur or image damge.It's too much value for Money. Must buy if you want have a really good ph at this budget <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>I am actually promoting, recommending this phone to family members!

    This phone is a beast. The things that could have been focused on are \"Fast charging charger as the 6000 mah battery took almost 3 hours to get fully charged\" & \"Back cover quality which seems to be cheap\". Except these this phone fares really well with this price tag.

    So its been amost 10 days using this device and I must share that I'm happy with the performance of it.The delivery was done next day only which was impressive,the Galaxy M31 comes with fairly basic packaging. Apart from the device itself, you get a 15W fast charger and a charging/data cable.Prior to this i was using realme 3 pro and M31 suprasses that in every aspects whether it is camera,one ui 2.0,design or battery.Overall it is a good buy in this price.

    Excellent phone by Samsung. My first Samsung phone. I am 5.5 years Mi fan. I was waiting for Note 9 Pro but after launch of Note 9 Pro, I decided to go with another brand. I was looking for Super AMOLED screen & big battery. So I decided Samsung M31. Although it is not having very fast charger. Even though it is best in its class.Best parts are:ScreenCameraSoundCall qualityWeightBattery

    I was really disappointed when I figured that there were no eardphones included in brand new Galaxy M31. And when I searched in faq I got to know that Samsung India wants to gives flexibility to users. This is ridiculous that you now want users to buy earphones separately. At least you should provide basic earphones. The phone is good but I am shocked to know the no earphones are included while some companies have even started giving phone covers also.

    Amazing product. Camera quality is very nice, rear camera gives crystal clear pic thiugh I would recommend a little working on the front facing camera. The 6bg-128gb variant is the best as you get a pretty good ram and heavy storage capacity and it would last long. Product design is very attractive and gives a rich look and I must say they do have value of money. It is worthevery penny you spent. Over all I am more than satisfied with the device.<U+0001F60A>

    Samsung M31 comes with a smooth touch mega amoled screen which gives a very nice user experience. The camera quality of 64MP is really up to the mark. Long lasting 6000mah battery is  something you can not ignore in this mobile.The only thing which is missing here is a earphone which doesn't  come with the package. Price of the M31 6+128 is also very much reasonable.Overall experience  is great. Keep up the good work.

And even the sound quality is also very good . Whenever I saw a movie I feel that that I am in the cinema hall. Because the display of the phone and the sound quality.

    Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

    1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. <U+0001F44D>

    Lot of heating issues, Picture quality is dam bad, Battery not at all look like 6000 MAH, it is hardly 3000 MAH. Taking 4 hrs to full charge and draining like any thing. No match to the technology from Chinese Products like OPPO,LENOVO and Realme. Way behind compared to chinese products. Humble request to all, not to buy this product...

    It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.

    Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.

Worst part of Amazon policy now you can't return at alll moreover not even replace easily,  you need to install the app then you will surprise  all the problems you face shall be found ok in the software. You will be in difficult to face the situation. My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.

    Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.

    I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked...Can we replace with M30s?...

    I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone

    I thoroughly like this mobile.Very smooth to handle.The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.

    I will be completely honest about my review after 2 days of ordinary usage...If you are attracted to this phone because of 64MP camera then wait a minute...my iPhone 5s with 8MP takes better photos than this phone.I don't know it's hardware or software issue. The software can be fixed with future updates.  Photos are blurry in all kinds of shots.  What is \"Macro\"?I don't understand.  It takes completely unfocused blurry pics.So if you are buying Rs.15000 phone for the camera then NO...I won't discourage the people who want to buy it for performance. It's fabulous in that department.6GB RAM really helps anyhow?I don't know...I find little lag during jumping to multiple apps...But I am satisfied with the product because Camera is not a priority for me.Additionally I don't know how many ours should a battery last with 6000mAh with moderate use but for me it lasts for 24hr on average without gaming.Fingerprint: 4/5Battery: 4/5Camera: 1/5Performance: 3/5Overall: 3/5.

    Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.

Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.6, Good call quality and Cellular Reception. value for money at this price .

    Guys don't become a fool and buy this phoneThe phone will start hanging and will switch off in between a call. Touch will not work , you have to end up pressing the touch multiple times to accept end calls or to do any work on phone.Battery life is ok okPhones started hanging in just 2 daysAnd more painful is that Amazon does not have return policy for this. They will send some technician to check it and \"if \" he finds issue phone will be replaced.If I would have known this I would never have purchased it from here.Now only god knows how my problem will be solved. I have came across such issue 1st time ever as I always preferred to buy such electronic items from physical store or not to go for any random low budget phone to avoid any complexity.Rethink before buying this phone from amazon ( if u faced any difficulty they won't return or refund the amount)

    One of the best satisfying phone I ever had in my life. After 7 days of use I find that the phone has a longer battery storage keeps long lasting , camera,  videos  and functions like hyperlapse,  slow motion mode,  superslowmotion mode is commendable to use. Display is big enough with curve design, looks are fantastic.  Eye catching masterpiece. Speakers are good ..faster enough..Go for it people

Single charge for 2 days minimum.Screen clarity is good. SAMOLED displayProcessor speed is ok.Played PUBG for continous 3 hours. Battery drained by 10% only.Phone is light weight.Wifi calling.5G wifi support.Loved this dark mode.Samsung VPN.Cons:Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.Camera quality is average.Full charge requires 2 hrs.Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.

    Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:a) Good processing power and RAMb) Sufficient internal memory & expansionc) Good batteryd) Good cameraI'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.Some of the built-in features are good.In short, I'm happy with my purchase.

    This is my first Samsung mobile i ever buy and worse product I ever buy. Plz don't be mislead by 64mp quad cameras and 6000amh battery. Fast charging literally doesn't work it took almost 2hours to get 100% charge with 15w charger . Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .

    Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.Pros-1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.Average features-1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.Cons-1. No cover provided within the box.2. No headphones provided.3. No Samsung secure folder.4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. <U+0001F44D>

    I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day. Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.I expect this might be software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me. Plz no bay this mobile

    I have been loyal Samsung user for years now. This one works smooth but trying to get used to its screen length. Camera works fine. I haven't noticed any difference between normal cam mode and 64mp mode, but both are fine. Macro lens version is to be simply admired. Slow motion works well too. Overall it's a good phone. I am satisfied.

    One of the best options in the segment.I preferred this phone for its sAMOLED display  and I am very happy  with it's look and performance.  To my surprise software one UI is smooth performing and practical.  Samsung's galaxy M series has been trustworthy brand against many aggressive competitors. Packaging and charger design could have been better. Anyhow satisfied with choice.

    Almost every call gets dropped after 20 to 30 seconds. On same SIM , other phones are working fine. So , its device problem.Expected more on other side but not up to expectations. Over all rating a B- if calls drop issue is resolved, else its worthless.

    This phone for its price is best in class. While Chinese phones may pack more features but Samsung is clearly a class apart.It has the best fingerprint reader which is blazing fast.The camera is excellent at the price point and the AR feature is a new addition that is quite fun.The battery life is awesome. With a 6000 mAh battery it will always last a full day and then some more.It charges quickly even though it has a large battery thanks to the included fast charger.The screen is the best at the given price point with crisp and vivid images.The phone is snappy with zero lag. It runs smoothly.The fact that it can support dual Sims and an SD Card without any glitches and the fact that you don't have to decide between having two sim cards or one sim and an SD card is excellent.The gesture controls are handy and call quality is excellent.All in all this is completely worth the money. At this price point you simply can't get a better phone

    Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.

    Before reviewing my samsung M31, I would like to share what I was actually seeking in a phone.1. Best available battery life with fast charging2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)3. A nice camera4. Good enough processor for multitasking5. Additional slot for expandable memoryThis M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.

    Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phonesIssues--Heavier than MI phones--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones. You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously--screen mirroring is very poor does not works-- Camera is also poor than MI phones-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.-- many other usability issues.--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability

    Worst battery life, It takes 5 hours to charge 100%, Battery Drains in 12 hours only for normal usage, Decreasing Customer Faith, There is nothing  correct details regarding  battery as it shows in the phones features, Amazon Also Takes Too much  Time For Inpection And Its Technician Are Also Fraud, It is So Hard To Replace might be impossible And there is no return or refund policy, So it's better not to Buy It on Amazon and save your money.

    Hi Guys, Writing Review after using the device for almost 2 weeks. TBH, I was about to buy Redmi Note 8 pro which is in same price range as this one but after thorough comparison i bought Samsung M31.Pros :1. Amazing camera. Samsung's M31's photos are more lively and provide you natural element of the clicking environment.2. Battery Life. It takes upto 2-2.5 Hrs to fully charge the phone and you can use the phone for almost whole day. whole day because at the time of writing this review Lockdown is going on India due to Corornavirus, so i am  always watching Videos and surfing Instagram and Facebook in it.3. Amoled screen - gives you amazing experience with Videos and movies.Cons:1. Not for Gaming - Since i am not gamer, this device perfectly suits my needs. But If you are interested in playing games i would suggest to go with other devices.2. Charger - Should have given more powerful charger since 6000mah takes alot of time to charge the device with the provided charger.3. Back of the phone does not feel premium. Feels like a plastic coverup.

    The phone is absolutely amazing!!! I have bought it myself on the very first day of the sale, and by my usage of about 9 to 10 days, the phone is absolutely killer. Although it's not aimed for gamers in mind, the m31 still pulls off games with great ease and no lag. Moreover, the phone feels lightweight as a feather despite packing in a 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging, which charges this battery in about 2 hours. The display is the best part of the phone. Extremely gorgeous display with a small notch. Moreover, the quad camera array at the back houses an 64 MP camera, which gives extremely detailed photos. The 8MP ultrawide and the Macro camera also are the best in this price bracket. I am exceptionally happy to upgrade from my old phone to this one, and I would recommend it to someone who is a causal gamer and wants a phone with a big battery, great display and awesome cameras. The hashtag used by Samsung #MegaMonster is truly apt for this phone.

    Its a good product,  if you are Samsung fan or looking to buy Samsung mobile, M31 is recommended in this price range. Good Camera, 6000mh battery is enough to sustain for 1.5 days. Great display, dynamic colors, looks premium with a high quality case.Audio Sound can be better.

    I am using Samsung mobile since last 3 years. First one was J7 pro second A70 now Now M31 but all processor works in same way. You can't imagine some time it's take 10 second to connect the call after receiving so conclusion is that it doesn't matter you spend 15k or 60k in Samsung mobile the problem of hang will remain same. Very Poor performance just wastage of money.

    Before i bought this product I've checked a lot of reviews and as everyone said it's good for people who consume a lot of media i went ahead and bought this.. This phones got one of the best displays in this price segment.. it's an awesome experience to watch movies and shows in this phone. And with the amazing battery backup of 6000mah we can watch shows continuosly for hours. The camera quality is also really awesome. I love everything about this phone except the charging speed.. it takes me around 3 hours to fully charge. I wish they would have added a much more faster charger instead of that 15W. Also sometimes the face unlock is bit slow or unresponsive. But as a whole i absolutely love this product.

    I am very happy to review on my recent purchase Samsung M31 mobile phone.Performance is very Good as it is having Octa core processor with 6 GB RAM.The Display is Super Amoled with 6.4 inch screen which is fantastic & I can say that No other phone comes closer in this budget segment.The highlight of the mobile is its Camera, possessing Quad camera of 64+ 8 + 5 + 5 MP Primary Cameras & 32 MP Front Camera. The attached photos are taken from this phone as the font size is so small to read, Phone helped me in reading see the clarity.Now I will give 5 rating for its monster Battery of 6000mAhWhy I strictly Recommend others to go for this phone because of its lowest SAR value.Overall my rating is 5.

    Well its my first time using a Samsung android phone. To be honest I wasn't expecting that good device. I wanted a phone with good battery with a great display and m31 is a total banger om this one. The battery lasts for 2 days and the amoled screen is amazing. Apart from screen and battery this packs a great deal of utility. Samsung one ui is awesome, tbh I'm loving this. I've played cod and mcoc on this and they run quite smooth.Talking about some not so exciting feature is camera quality, on paper they look great but in original the camera is less sharp it's beautifys and soften the image. And yes it's little bit chunky in terms of weight. And yes it takes a long time to charge.Overall its a great deal.9/10 recommended.

Also on this phone the network bar for vodafone network shows only 2 lines whereas on my other mobile it shows full network of vodafone. Worst phone . I suggest people not to go for this phone. It is definitely not a 6 gb ram phone. 6 gb ram is only on papers and not actual.

But now I'm using it and sAMOLED display is awesome.4. Dolby audio is available for earphones.5. Android 10 is available.6. Heat dissipation is less.7. I bought 128GB version, and in that 116GB is available for me.8. For full charge it is taking 2 - 2 and half hours.Cons:1. As the phone is having single speaker, so Dolby audio not available without earphones.As I don't play games, so I don't think processor bothers me much.

I was waiting for best back cover but till then I have my phone got multiple rashes on back panel.And one thing is that, phone is getting on hold mode during the call. This is because, option button is getting eneble on right up side during call and accidentally it's getting touch.But Still I am happy what I got.

    There are features in the phone which are disabled. Slowmo & super slowmo recording are not clear even with proper lighting. Normal camera recording not gr8,my J5 Prime did a better job. This phone has not lived up to expectation. Extremely disappointed.

    Overall the phone is good, but seems a little laggy, experienced screen blackout for the second time in my 15day usage, camera performs fantastic offers a great tone balance but struggles indoors in super steady mode, yet great details captured by 64&32mp lenses. The super amoled panel is the might of the phone with perfect viewing angles. The battery lasts for a full 2days with heavy usage.If compared with vivo v1x pertaining to internet speed when using browser and downloading apps m31 is a lot slower in terms of downloading as compared to vivo both running on jio sim & same plans.

    There is sound defect ( problem  ) in the mobile.  Once we receive a call then the sound does not work, we are unable to hear any video. Then again we have to restart the mobile to hear the volume. Due to Lockdown we were unable to return the mobile on the given time.So I here by request you to replace the defected mobile with  new mobile.

    Overall M31 6GB/128GB is a complete package worth for Rs.15999. It has best Camera & battery in this amount.But processor Samsung M31 has exynos 9611, should have snapdragon 7932. It is compatible but not that much fast as snapD...I order for Ocean Blue.. Amazon sent me Black coloured... that is really bad on Amazon part.. I still kept this piece as I was OK with the colour.Sound quality is good. With headphones the feature of DolbyAtoms is awesome..It is a better mobile to use, in this amount..

    Very good phone in this range. All must go for it rather than redmi, vivo or other phone in same budget. Camera is very nice and hang issues are completely resolved by Samsung. I have been using Samsung from 2015 and it has improved a lot in low budget phones also.  Battery is powerful and durable than all other android phone.

    Best phone in this price,I read all negative reviews,But when I use m31 from 1week ,iI found conclusion that,this phone is far ahead of Chinese brand,it looks premium, camera is best,Some functions only me has isDARK MODE,SUPER SLOW MOTION PICTURE &AUDIO,THE S AMLOID EXPERIENCE IS ROCKING.And lastly those who have negative reviews or some problems for m31 ,is only matter of users understanding because this phone have much advance features in camera and os &it takes atleast 1week to full understand & remember all this

    This is the worst Samsung phone I ever had. I have been always a Samsung user. But this time this model of phone is very worst.- The phone hangs each and every time,specially while typing...- 1st it hangs and then it automatically get restart. Or sometimes it get restart without doing anything.

    I ordered Samsung galaxy m31 on 5th March delivered in 6th march I will check battery life almost 1.5 days it will be run of heavy usage to seeing videos on YouTube,WhatsApp & other apps are run and internet  connection always on . Display colour , quality and touch response is good . Sound is not loud but in headphones Dolby atmos support is great experience. Camera creates such nice images.one complain about Samsung why they not give back cover , screenguard, and headphones.charger is slow because battery is big.

    Best value for money in this mid range segment..1. Plus point is Super Amoled display with the vibrant and eye-catching colors...For display can't beat any other brands.2. 64mp quad camera's quality is truly awesome.. it captures very nice photos.3. Mega monster 6000 Battery is one more plus point, although weight distribution is great...It will give you near about 2 days long battery backup.4. Fingerprint sensor is also fast.Overall it is super mega monster & king of all brands

    This product has very good performance. It has highest battery life which is 6000 mah. Fingerprint reader is also very effective and also the camera recognizes the face in a fraction of seconds. This is a fantastic camera mobile too with 64 MP quad camera. It also has selfie camera with 32 MP. The design looks very slim and beautiful. However, the keypad strucks sometimes when it is overused. It is the mobile with all the features i.e., camera(64 MP), battery life(6000 mah), sleek and stylish.

    This is the best phone that you can ever ask for if your budget is under 16k. sAMOLED display, 6000 mah battery, 64 MP rear cam, 32MP front cam and the 6gb ram - 128gb rom combo are the deal breakers. Go for it blindly. I have used phones of redmi(xiaomi) & realme previously. I can definitely vouch for the Samsung brand for all the above mentioned features. Thank you Samsung for such a marvel.

    This phone is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. Camera quality is very good and The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach.The fingerprint sensor works just fine and not faced any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good and overall performance of phone is good.....

    This phone other than battery backup is a waste of money I have recently bought it the speakers don't work properly  sound quality of speakers is very bad, camera quality I'd average don't go by the camera specifications and advertisements and the phone I have bought has major sound problems the sound just shuts itself. It goes mute itself when I am listening to music even in ringing mode phone just vibrates and nothing else speakers doesn't  work properly

    After usage of almost 15 days I concluded that battery is not as expected. It takes 2.5 to 3 hours to get fully charged and drained in a day even after normal usage.Earlier I had moto one power which had 5k mah battery which was far better then this.Over all performance is satisfactory but battery performance disappointed so far. It works like 3k mah.

    Overall performance of Samsung M31 is good. But really unhappy with the camera quality. Picture quality does not match with 64 MP camera, even resolution is also very poor. In Macro mode, there is no any option for auto focus. Totally unsatisfied camera performance. May be Samsung will update and improve it's camera software for M31 later on.

    Finally a budget phone which is truly a flagship killer. A blind choice for specially those who extensively use their phone all day long till late night. 6000 mAh says it all!! Macro lens is a very good add to the phone and like always Samsung is very good with its display but to providing it to a budget phone is also an added benifit.The best part about this phone is even though it has such a big battery spec it feels light and good to hold.

    In 45 days, I am experiencing speaker and mic problems.  Both have stopped working even though I handled the phone very carefully.  I also have a Samsung S8 and it's working fine since  2017.  So, is there there quality issues only with M31?  I hope they replace the faulty phone.  My family also uses a Vivi V15 for 1 year but it never gave problem like this Samsung M31.

    I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund

Because its took worst...I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...

    A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

    Fair review after one week of usage:Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.

    Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.

    I have a good working phone -samsung A8 plus.. still purchased this phone as I  was excited with its features of 64 MP camera and 6000 mAmp battery-- both these features are a huge disappointment in this phoneno differnce from A8+ - or even worseno back cover/screen guard; purchased them online, before they come and start using this phone -return window expired..No fast charging as claimed, infact very very slow charging.......atleast no heating issues like other cheaper brandsscreen, touch sensitivity, fast processor -- are goodsound is again a disappointmentslow motion video and live focus on both cameras, both sim Volte enabling  - are the good features

    Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and \"reduce animations\" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table

    The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.

    Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.

    Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.

    Review after 4 days usage:The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.Pros:1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah3. Display is crisp and very sensitive4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.Cons:1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung

    I upgraded from a 4 year old samsung. So as soon as I got hands on experience with this phone, I was amazed by how smooth the experience was.Samsung has moved onto the budget phone market and has established an elegant line of phones.Pros: - The finger print sensor is fast and very responsive - The battery lasts a good 2 days. - Faster compared to other budget phones in the 15k~ range - The build quality is nice - Despite the size, it's a very light phoneCons: - Battery takes 3 hours to charge completely - Even though it has a nice back, it is prone to fingerprints, and scratches - Thicker than normal

    I purchased this device on the very first day of it release, I purchased it for my Dad as he wanted a device which is simple enough to use with enough battery for everyday use and good camera to take pictures.He is not a gamer nor he is a power user , thus looking at the criteria which he needed this phone was making all right ticks .My dad is extremely happy with his purchase although when I have used the phone to just see how it is , I feel there are some software issues for example sometimes he says face unlock works sometimes it doesn't , which I believe is just a simple software fix .

    Phone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.

    A very awesome mobile, a complete  value for money.Main highlights are its awesome display, battery and performance.One can argue with the performance when u take gaming into account. But believe  me even in gaming its performance  is awesome.Its a daily life phone, awesome super amoled display for entertainment ,6000MAH battery for continuous work and decent performance.The thing i dont liked that much...1. Camera pic output...some are good some are not natural, its seems artificial.2. No fast charging support..it takes nearly 2hr 45 mins to charge it completely.These are not major negatives about this phone if compare at the price its been offered.GO AHEAD FOR IT.....<U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>

    This is honest review after 10 days of use. The phone looks promising with the features detailed in website. I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varientPros:1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.Cons:1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.

    I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks now and I must say that I am very much impressed. The camera quality is just amazing. Even in low lights, the picture quality is amazing. The screen is always been a usp of Samsung phones and this phone screen lives upto the expectations. Battery life is simply amazing. For me it goes thru the second day with almost 4 to 5 hours of gaming, 2 to 3 hours of internet surfing and calls as well. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good as well. I have not experienced any lag while using the phone and switching between different apps is smooth. Overall a nice phone in such great price.

    Ok ok product...I don't know how people are giving so much rating for this product...My review post 2 weeks of usage:Pros:Budget friendlyNice camera with nice features.especially wide angle and slow motion.Nice amoled display.Battery is also ok.Cons:front camera adding so many filters which I dont like...missing the natural picture die to these filters.camera specs dient match the quality of pictures.Battery is taking around 3 hours from 0 to 100 which is too much time.at the same time draining in 1 and half days of modern usage.Face lock is not smooth sometimes responding bit slow.Very low sound comparative my any previous models whether its samsung series or redmi series.Mobile also doesn't works seamlessly.taking 1 or 2 secs to open the app some times.Finally so so product.and could be I expected too much from the config they mentioned abt.

    Bought the m31 (6+128) both space black and ocean blue variants for me and my brother.here are my views about the device.Pros:1.Super amoled display which is more vibrant than IPS LCD pannels2.Stunning blacks Thanks to the Samsung's SAMOLED DISPLAY.3.Massive 6000 mah battery which lasts for around  1 and half to 2 based on our usage.4.super user friendly thanks to samsung ONEUI 2.0 the interface is too Good.5.come with android 10 out of the box.6.The quad camera setup is decent enough and there is some auto focus issue which I think may be corrected with an update.7.Decent performer for games like pubg,call of duty etc....8.Always on display is very useful and get done the task of notification LED ofcourse there is some battery drain because of this feature.But trust me it is very less than you expected.Cons:1.supports 15W fast charging only which make the total charge time to around 2h 30 mins .but remember the capacity is around 6000mah which take more time to charge.2.Design is too old as we are getting glass finish in other brands within this budget range.3.Need improvement in the speed of unlocking phone using biometrics.

    Personally I loved Galaxy series, the Make in India products...Features :* With normal usage, the phone lasted over 2 days and you don’t need to carry a power bank with you anymore.* Super AMOLED display is great and highly customizable with detailed colors.* Fingerprint & biometric are pretty quick* Battery life is exceptional for this device 6000maH , lasts 2days with ease (minimal gaming)* * Cameras are whole new chapter, high resolution cameras capture shots with huge detail...Whats more interesting are the AReality support for this device...(in core)* Even Flashlight has modes of brightness which is pretty useful...Overall this is a great device at this price range supported by Samsung's best apps and customization...Its a beast in performance, battery and camera...

    I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.Pros:Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.

    Review after 18 days uses of phone....Only Display is really very good...5/5. Rest is worst dream....!!!1. For full charging...it will take almost 3 hr. And heating a lot.... even you can't take a call2. I have used mirroring function....initially worked smoth ...but after 50 minutes msg pop up mobile over heated it will shut down in 20 sec.....!!!  Note : battery % is 67 that time ...i have charged 100% after before starting mirroring function. (And it is not in charging).3. Network is very bad....in my home almost no internet work and in office also. (Note : at same location my previous phone samsung on 7 working superb in internet.)4. Phone call cut during talking with other.5. Battery...draining very rapidely....it is only last for 12 to 14 hrs. On moderate uses. I have doubt on 6000 mH...!!6. No zoom in 64 mp camera ...allthough rear camera is good but zoom is not attractive.7.  Front camera ...really worst. In day light 3/5. But in night 1/5.8. Note that i have not installed any gaming app....yes no single gaming  app...This all happening without any gaming app like pubg.9. User interface is 4/5.Oveall really disappointed  with samsung .... i am user of only samsung since last 12 yrs.

    Likes : The phone looks stunning and packs great features. The best part 6000 MaH battery which never feels bulky as the weight is balanced so nicely. The phone comes with all positive features in good price point. The UI is easy to use and no useless preinstalled apps like Realme phones. It makes all sense to buy this device with name tag Samsung.Dislikes: The camera could have been better. The back panel gets scratches easily during daily use and finger prints are easily noticeable. But this might be the case with most of the phones in this price range.Conclusion : The phone comes with all good configurations in a good price point and there is no need to spend extra for just higher processor speed. Of course the more you spend the more you get but remember all phone get old and new ones replaces them sooner.

    I've bought Samsung M31 6GB|128GB in Ocean Blue through Amazon,we all know that most of the branded products where newly arrive we can get cheaper & also genuine only on Amazon,About this product i would like to say it has all the features which we want in our cell phone like camera clearity coz it has 32MP front camera with UHD & 64MP back UHD quadruplecamera with slow motion & other options which i liked & 6000 mAH battery gives us long backup with fast charging  adapter & its screen size is 6.4 inches allow us to watch video in High resolution quality& many other options,if you're thinking to buya phone i don't think any other brand give youSuch superior quality which samsung gives.

    This phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it...

    Good phone in this budget and better than mi redminote 8 pro.First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good

    I got M31 on 6th March and with  in a month time there was a software update on April 10th. I accepted the software too  my goodness the mobile got hanged and its in downloading status from morning 11 am on wards........... Its like dum next to me .Reason is there is a software issues in the mobile and also the mobile is getting hanged often.Its not worth to buy in Samsung  no value for money and it a stress for us.

    Things that this phone does not live up to its promise:1. Front camera quality is not good. Dosent feel like a 32 MP definitely. Don't forget to  turn off the beauty mode.2. The night mode amplifies  up things artificially3. The main camera does not live upto the 64 mp hype- 48 MP cameras of other phones may be better. However for the price the macro, background blur effect and daylight photos are good.The operating system with the android  10 is good, screen quality is super, built is nice, fingerprint  sensor  very responsive,  no lags, decent sound quality, super battery.

    Amazing phone, smooth, feels more like i phone 11. Its battery takes a lot of tike to charge...but once charged alcan be used foreverOkay so, the phone is better than any other phone launched recentlyI guess its been some weeks since i have been using this but this monster feels just like  a brand new one.My suggestion is never put a screen guard or a tempered glass on the phone coz it lags the phone and touch response becomes really bad BUT..there s a setting for the screen guard users to increase sensitivity and it goes smooth againThe phone s brilliant and i love the performance and its very light in weight. The battery backup is cool and long lasting.I literally watched a 3 hour movie with just 16percent charge in phone..I suggest all the customers to buy a m31

    Highly satisfied with the looks of this phone..... camera is great but still trying to figure out what to do with macro mode.... performance is a bit compromising but still can't say it's bad in this price..... previously I was using Samsung M30 which had 5000mah battery but in that Battery lasted more than in this device.... would highly recommend to try this phone.....It can actually be called upgraded version of M30.....<U+0001F61A> I like it because of its display, camera and looks.... performance could have been more efficient but still it's good enough for daily use and gaming also. It has letest version of Android so hopefully it'll get newer versions of Android sooner in comparison of other devices running on older versions of Android.....In M30 also got upgraded versions quickly

    The ultimate phone to have in the M series of Samsung.As I have already been a user of M30s, I can very accurately describe I went for M31.Besides the usual camera upgradation from 48MP to 64 MP (rear) and 16MP to 32MP (front) , I find M31 simply more responsive and compatible under my fingers. Besides a 6GB internal system storage and Android 10 OS gives you the feeling of a powerful machine in your hand.Plus you get the whole package of 6000mAh Battery, 6.4 super amoled display and cool design that gives you the feeling of a premium smart-phone.Well in nutshell, I can say this phone is a serious winner under the category of budget phone with all premium specifics and a sure thing to hang on to once you buy it.Happy to buy it from Amazon, super-fast, hassle free delivery.Word of Advice- Also buy a protective display glass and back cover to give your phone an ever-lasting long life.

    I think it is the best phone under 15000/- .Fingerprint sensor is fast and there is no issue about it. Camera quality is superb but i think if the camera's aperture were 1.7 then it will destroy every other company's smartphone in camera segment though it has very nice capacity to take very good pictures. The pics taken by it still so awesome. Atlast the battery life is very good. If someone wants to increase the battery life then they can use some tricks like blocking wifi scanning, blocking nearby device scanning , blocking bluetooth scanning,  using, dark mode, blocking unwanted notifications from the apps, using power saver mode, ultra data saver mode, and data saver mode. Then battery performance will be raise to the extreme.

    The phone is really a mega monster and well worth the price. 128GB and 6GB RAM, 6000mAh battery along with a decent processor and camera is a steal at this price range. But my camera seems to have a problem where all the corners of the photo except a central circle become blurry and so i cannot take a whole picture of even a page. It might be a hardware problem in my device or it could be a software problem as well. Besides this issue the phone works great.

    Phone is a steal at current price, giving best specs in the range and lots of features.  Samsung has really worked and delivered a product which exceeds market expectations.Samsung has done amazing job on the latest One UI. It is more intuitive and fast. Also, it works very well with all sorts of apps.Of course, the camera is exceptional,  especially its  64MP mode which has good detailing.The display also looks excellent as it's super amoled which was only available in higher end models until now.Holding and using the phone is also very easy due to sleek design and less weight even with the mega battery. The battery backup is amazing,  giving me 2 days battery life on single charge with good usage.Definitely worth every rupee.

    Galaxy M31's camera sure lives up to my expectations. The picture quality in low light is awesome and the phone is comparatively light given the battery capacity. It took around 2.5 hours for a full charge and lasted for roughly 1.5 day on my normal usage. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of IR blaster and One UI. One UI doesn't have out of the box support for things like internet speed meter and number of fingerprints that can be registered is limited to 3. Overall it's a good purchase within given price, especially if you're a camera fanatic.

    After using this phone for 2 month & more, I am giving this review ( a short review) after viewing this you can really impress with this phone,my observations are:1.everyone is looking for such a phone with a very good camera quality,in this phone with 64 MP camera the images are really appreciable.2. Now I come to its battery it has 6000 mah of battery life,which lasts a long ,in my recent days I watch movies,playing games but it doesn't last.3. Now about its look, very attractive especially it's back with superb camera design .I impressed.4. With the given processor it doest create any hindrance while using any heavy size gaming app.So I want to say as I experienced, it is really very impressive with this budget.

    Fingerprint sensor needs to be more robust. Battery charging time is more even though claimed to be fast charging. There are very many options as double tap sleep which is not available here, whereas in similar price range phones we get lot of options/features. One important thing is the charger cable length is too short, not up to the standards of Samsung. Samsung - if you are unable to provide decent features/options in this price range, please don't roll out mobiles here and downgrade your standard.

    It is a best phone in the range of 15000. Fingerprint reader of m31 is great it just takes a moment after touching your finger to the sensor. Its battery is awesome, I can't believe that it has 6000 mAH battery. Camera is mind blowing, 64 MP camera in such a low price. What more I say about m31.... Thank you Samsung for manufacturing this device in such low price.

    System:System UI Stopped - my phone encounters this issue often and gets shut down in the mid of a phone call or at times of camera usage and restarts after a couple of long minutes. Moreover, the phone gets heated up too often with minimal usage of surfing (no gaming).Camera: Not as promised. Not worth a single rating as the pictures are distorted when taken at night.64MP (no zoom ) fails in comparison to a 16MP cam quality ....the picture taken are sharp and blurred when zoomed.The only good thing is fast charging and battery life. Overall M31 is an average phone with nothing as promised by Samsung.

    After using this phone for 1 week, these are the below terms which I found* Camera is awesome*Battery lasts 24 hours after heavy usage (watched 3 movies played PUBG around 3 hours and PES around 2 hours and YouTube etc)*Speaker built quality is good*Display quality is awesome*Minor heating issue after heavy usage*Full charge from 10-100 in 1 hour 10 minute (6000 mah battery dude)*fingerprint is okay*Face Unlock not so good in dark lightPhone is perfect for this price range. You can consider it if you want a good battery life along with good camera.

    This Samsung m31 is just awesome, I specially loved the wide angle option.And it just easily connects with our samsung smart TV, today is 27.3.2020 the quarantine day past 3 days we were at home watching  movies through smart view ,we enjoyed it.i think it's a awesome budget Mobile and I love the design, color combination is stunning and I was playing free fire for nearly two hours, it just took 20 percent of the battery it also can be used as a gaming device. Speaker was stunning. And front camera was nice ,I think it would be a great phone for vloggers, I suggest that every one can buy this mega monster.

    Samsung has tried to incorporate all the modern features of the segment in the Galaxy M31. It has gracefully managed to offer a slight spec bump to keep up with the latest trends. The company has proved the fact that minor updates can make a phone slightly better!The M31 brings Android 10 out-of-the-box, a 64-megapixel rear camera, a massive 6000mAh battery capacity and an impressive 6.4-inch AMOLED display. There's an adequate amount of 6GB RAM and 64GB/128GB storage options too.In a nutshell, you can go for Galaxy M31 if you want a reliable battery, an immersive display and camera-centric features packed in a handset.

    If I tell Truth.....Really i got more from expectation in this budget segment.Performance is Absolutely Stunning in daily usage as well as in gaming also.The massive battery of phone 6000mAh is give you full and half day battery backup.And what i say of Super amoled Display and 64mp Stunning Camera, 32 mp selfie gives you smile. And also Samsung One UI 2.0 gives you a best UI experience ever . Personally I recommend to you go without doubt. <U+0001F917>

    I have wasted my 16000<U+20B9> on this phone. Company show that it have 6000mah battery which is false. Its take 4 hours to charge 25% of battery. Too much heating issue. Camera quality is poor as company show it is 64mp camera. I suggest please do not buy thia phone. Do not waste your money on this phone.

    Front cam is bad. Finger print scanner and backpanel has a slight gap which gathers dust around it. Face unlock and fingerprint lock is a bit slow though. Battery works okay. If backpanel was also made of gorilla glass it would be better as it gets dusty and greasy every time u use it. phone is heavy. Back Cam doesnt look even close to 64 mp. The so called front screen broke after falling from a very small height and there is no backcover available and even repair shops dont have its spare parts

    Been using this phone for a week now, definitely a value for money. The camera is REALLY good and what makes this model stand apart is the BIG BATTERY. I've been using my phone continuously for 2 days now and I still have around 20% charge left.Not an avid gamer, but it does a good job there as well.The only drawback I felt was, no earphones/back cover provided in the box.Overall, definitely a value for money phone with the latest Android version.

    I was thinking to buy Samsung S20 Ultra. One of my friend told me about M31 launch and i checked about the features on internet. I fell in love with M31 and decided to go for it instead of S20 and i am proud to say that my decision was correct. This is a Mega monster for sure. 64 MB camera, 6 Gb RAM, 128 Gb memory and 6000 mAH battery. Everything is same as what you expect from a flagship phone. Camera is awesome, features are superb and no comparison to the battery, it lasts for 2 days for me. Thankyou Samsung for M31 launch.

    Things which make this device a good pick:1)Amoled display makes the user experience really smooth.2)camera quality in outdoors is amazing.3)body design is nicely crafted,people asked me which phone is this often.4)the user interface is nicely designed so there is no confusion and mismanagement.Few cons:1)Camera can dissapoint sometimes in low light.2)battery drains faster but 6000mah manages it well.3)charging upto 70% is fast then it takes time

The phone sometimes restarts itself and sometimes gets stuck on Samsung itself for about 1 hour.2. To much phone heating issue in normal uses.3. To much phone hanging issue even some time phone is stuck for 1 to 2 hours.4. I have raised the issue with Samsung but not get any solution from Samsung Team.

Both rear and selfie camera comes with flash which is an added advantage.  Touch sensitivity is perfect. Processor is fast but could have been better compared to other models like one plus. I ordered it on the same day it was launched.  I would strongly recommend this phone to others. Overall it is a perfect model at nominal price.

    HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.

    I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable <U+0001F62D>. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too<U+0001F62C>. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails<U+0001F62D>. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps <U+0001F602><U+0001F923>. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been

    I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)

    I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily. The WiFi calling sometimes does not work!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not the same as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better with my old phone of 5000mah...could do 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'.

    Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .Pros :1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .Cons :1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.

    Phone is ok.Battery is good enough, there only plus point.Face detection does not work very poor,OTG is very good, Doc. Files transferred open directly without going through any app.Keyboard features not good in comparison to Google.Camera quality is just ok.Palm screen shot is not good.Adaptive screen doesn't work.Phone is slow.Power on off is missing.Plastic back cover gets scratched very fast.Videos plays in 2 steps, one in off volume.Samsung phones are not good for gear S2 watches, it connects through Samsung galaxy store which which does not show all the faces as In other phones & it also does not show the purchased watch faces.

    To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users

    This mobile has 6000mah battery but it last only one day.camera is not so good according to it megapixels.fingerprint some times not working but almost good.display and touch is good. The major problem is it's hanging. I am using this phone for last 45 days and it hangs 3 to 4 times and it takes 5 to 10 minutes and some times more to start working after hanging.i have Faith on Samsung but this hanging problem annoying me badly.Samsung needs to improve this issues.All other things are good.

    Initial reviewPerformance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.After one week of usageif the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.

    Very Good Features. You just can't compare with 2 yrs back Samsung mid range smartphones.  they were really not value for money. but now situation is different.  the screen is really superb. everything is good except face lock. and the best part is it's a very trustable brand. nowadays privacy is the biggest concern and after hearing about the Xiaomi's case i am not gonna trust any chinese brand. i have poco f1 too but now the situation is different and i will not trust any chinese brand again. It's a promise

    First of all , I would say the phone has extremely good battery life while using continuously (Gaming Netflix) it delivers upto 13-14 hrs backupFingerprint reader is very fast, phone gets unlocked with just a touchCamera quality is also very good in daylight and in low light it is satisfactoryI didn't face any lag while playing PUB-G , the phone did a great job. I also loved the Super amoled display, it delivers a very good quality viewing experience.Overall the phone is doing a great Job, I didn't face any problems as of now loved it :)

    This was definetely a great upgrade from Samsung for me as I have been a customer since last 5 years.Highlights for me1.Macro camera-It capture pictures with every minute details.2.64 MP camera-This is something next level as images were size more than 8 mb according to lighting conditions which is equivalent to dslr sizes and detailng is also crystal clear here.Moreover the Monster Battery that stands out over all of these  6000mah,once full charge in the morning can easily run for 2 days. Loved it.

Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.

    I ordered this phone within few hours of launch, and was promptly delivered the very next day. Thanks to Amazon for on time deliveryI bought the ocean blue, 128 GB variant which is kind of dark blue and I really love the colour. I am no techie to review the phone on its technical aspects but as a common layman I truly love its performance since the 3 days I have been using it.The set up  took really less time than I expected and it comes with Smart Switch App, which made the data transfer easy and smooth.The pictures clicked from the phone are extremely good and nice, however I saw a flicker of light when I tried to take a slowmotion video. I am not sure if the flickering was because of the light or the issue was with the camera. but there was not such flickering while capturing a slowmotion video in daylight.The battery back up seems to be amazing, Since 3 days I have charged it only once. (Other than the charging done on the first day for 3 hours). But the charging is not as fast, and I feel the 15V charger is not good enough for the 6000 MaH BatteryOverall I loved the phone it is smooth, fast and Vibrant.... and Im loving it

I love the product if u are searching a phone under 15000 u should buy samsung galaxy m31 6Gb with 64GB ROM. Features are amazing with new features and extra features than other phones under 15000rs. Camera quality is amazing with 64MP camera. It can help u read small words from a distance of 10m. Wide angle and macro shots are amazing. This phone is perfect in all fields in a very small price. Love u samsung for such nice product. Hope such new amazing products like this.

    Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.Samsung Galaxy M31 camerasI found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots

     Everything is Super Duper. All expectations from Samsung about this phone  came true. I was waiting for this phone since February when I listened on Amazon.The Battery 6000 MH and 6 GB RAM is enough for playing PubG and other Games without any Problems. 64 Mega pixels camera is good for capturing our memories. Mobiles look is slim and wait only 191gm with 6.4 inch screen. One more thing which I like is dual 4g support sim which was my problem in my Old Model J5 Prime.I always used Only Samsung phone (after Nokia keypad) in my Life.

    Display : This is an oled panel, the colors are  absolutely gorgeous. No flaws.Battery: This is again a plus point in this  device, I use my mobile phone for 2  or 3 days once it's fully charged.Camera : 64MP camera has some dynamic  range issues but it is good for the  price segment.  128 MP camera performs good in  daylight not in night.  Macro lens is great.  I usually take less selfies. But the  selfie cam is pretty decent.Charging time for this device is long because of the monster battery.I do not play games on mobile phones. So can't say much about gaming performance.I use a lot of applications concurrently and this device hasn't failed me yet.I am very satisfied with device.

    The phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice... Samsung has not disappointed me this time also. I happily suggest Samsung M31 to any normal user.

    There are multiple reasons to buy this product-1. The best specs at this price range.2. Samsung customer service and support is very good.since they have enormous number of service centres.3. The phone is very impressive in terms of looks.4. The battery is 6000mah which means you can stop worrying about the battery to drain fast.I bought this phone on the launch date 5 march and amazon delivered it within 24 hours.The 64MP camera works really good even in low light,This phone also boasts a 32 MP front camera making video calls super clear.Dolby atoms makes listening to songs and music very good experience.As far as screen is concerned super Amoled display with pixel density of 443 is best in class.I've been using the phone for about 4 days now and the phone works smoothly.The fingerprint sensor is fast.No heating problems detected so far PUBG works seamlessly in the ultra HD mode.I charged the phone to a 100% and then used the phone for about 45 min,to my surprise the battery was drained just to 1%.So my verdict on the phone-Battery life-10/10Camera-8/10Display-9/10Software-9/10Design-8/10Performance-8/10Value for money-10/10

    I am reviewing this after 1 week use of Samsung Galaxy M31.Design : Premium look and feel.Camera : M31 has best camera in its segment. Picture clicked on it has very minute details even if you click the image very closely. I have taken the few and you can check. I'll rate 5/5.Battery : Battery is also exceptionally well that lasts upto 2 days with moderate usage. 5/5Processor : Till now it is running very smooth. seeing no lag so again will give 5/5.UI: Samsung provides customer friendly User Interface. Face unlock works little bit slow but fingerprint sensor is very fast. 4.5/5Earlier I was using redmi note 6 pro but I found so many issues specially GUI and device hang, I decided to switch to samsung and till now I am pretty much satisfied with it.

    Samsung has been doing quite well with m-series smartphones. The newly launched Samsung Galaxy M31 is a really good phone. If you have a budget of ~15000/- then you can definitely go for this phone. Performance, battery life and camera quality is better than Xiaomi smartphones.

    The Best Ever Battery and Camera for limited budget..<U+0001F4A5><U+0001F4A5> Hope Samsung produces more new smartphones on this process with battery n camera .. The 1st Best Thing in Samsung M31 is  CHARGE almost lasts for 2 DAYS. The 2nd Best Thing is the yr MP Camera is very much better to capture the pictures with Live Focus, Pro Mode, Night Mode , Food Mode, Slow Mo, Super Slow Mo and Hyperlapse. As it is mentioned M31 is a Fast Charging mobile, it takes almost 3 hrs to charge 100%. It should have alleast charged 100% within half an hr to 45 mins. Charging Time is the only backlog for M31. Please Charge it during N8 hrs. If it is charged Once, It will Surely last for 1 and Half days for Sure for regular Mobile Users. It's best to buy this Mobile especially for Low Budget Users.

The new processor works buttery smooth with multiple apps running simultaneously. 4. Also a type C otg adapter would have been appreciated5. I would have loved to see Samsung release a matte black version of the phone, but the glossy \"space black\" still looks pretty good

    Considering how much it costed me and the brand I invested in , I very happily and confidently say that this phone is precisely everything that the advertisement say about it.  It's been 12 days since I bought this handset and so far I have never run out of battery. My son and I both, have been playing pubg for hours and though there are super minor glitches which one can easily ignore..this phone has been awesome. The camera and finger print sensors are super fine and quick.The phone appears more worth than its value to me.If you are planning to  buy a handset, go for M31 without even a single doubt in mind.

    6000 mAh  battery  . 32MP  front  camera. 64MP+8MP+5MP+5MP  rear  camera .Also  has  samsung  latest  ui  .  and  6  gb  ram  ,128  gb  storage.  In  16000 rupees ,  you  can't  ask  for  more.  Really , I  like  Samsung galaxy M31 . If  you  are  looking mobile for  watching  series  and  movies , Samsung galaxy M31 is  nice  . If  you  are  looking  for  gaming , Samsung galaxy M31 is  good, although  you  may  look  for  another  smartphones because Snapdragon is better  than Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 in  some  points. In  comparision  with  other  samsung  smartphones ,Samsung galaxy M31 has  one  disadvantage  that  Samsung galaxy M31 has  front  gorilla glass  3  and  no  rear  glass  while  some  samsung  phones  have  rear  glass.

    Okay so I bought the phone on the day it was released. The review is based the first week usage of the phone.1. Starting big just like it's battery. The 6000 mAh battery last for a day and half on moderate to high usage of the phone.2. Camera - the quad cam setup impresses more than one can expect, specially the 64 MP mode.3. The sAMOLED screen is blessing to the eyes. Brightness is no isssue even out in the sun.4. With it's 6gb ram one can just stop worrying about the lag.5. Even though it doesn't have a glass back. It still gives a premium feel.And with the brand like Samsung it is a must go phone under 15k.

    Previously I had used C9 Pro compared to that M31 was little bit fast and the battery backup was too good. Both front and back camera quality was superb. Im using this m31 mobile for more than a month and usage of mobile is high, like i would use mobile around 15 hrs in a day(most of time i use it for browsing) after that I will put the mobile in charging overnight (1 time in a day). While i put it on charge in day time i have observed it was getting charged to 15% to 100% with in 2hrs for a 6000 mah monstere battery. I'm really satisfied in battery backup side and camera side when compared to my previous mobile C9 Pro.  Really worth buying.

    The camera of this phone is really nice.The display of this mobile is also very good. I recommend this mobile to everyone who is in search of a phone with a good camera.The weight of this phone is also quite low. The only thing which did not meet expectations is the battery. Even though it states that it has a 6000mAh battery , it doesn't last for too long.

    The phone is great in this price range.The 4 reason that attracted me to buy this phone is° The brand name itself° 64 mp mega camera° 6000 mAh mega battery° Samsung Amoled displayThe camera quality is great, i tried slow motion video and the outcome was nice actually.I bought the 6/128 gb variant, it's pretty good.2 things i felt bad with in the 3 days is° first day itself the phone was getting hot, thats because an update and initial setup of the device° I couldn't find the network speed indicator in settings. Because in this internet generation we need to assure that we're getting enough speed for network.Overall its a mega monster with in this price range.

    Really this phone has monstrous battery, gives almost 2 -2.5 days power backup and phone has best camera available within this price range tooks awesome pics and the most highlighted thing about this phone is it's super AMOLED screen...woow Samsung cudos.Many people and yotube reviewer constantly cursing it's exynos 9611 processor but believe me man this processor is very powerful..dude it's Samsung they know how to tune it's own processor to work fluently with it's one UI 2.0 so this was from my end.And please don't compare this phone with Chinese phone.(oppo, vivo, Corona\"xiaomi\" etc.)

    It was good for about 10 days thereafter there are many issues. Everyday new prob n I am unable to take this to nearby samsung galaxy center as all shops are closed due to corona. Last 3 days it was restarting after every 5 min then I did factory data reset twice but issue did not solved. Then again there is issue with speaker. If i get any call phone doesnt ring even full volume is on. If i answer or make any call unable to listen to the person on the other side of the phone. No video n no music as if it has gone mute.

    General review - If you are looking for mobile which would long last without further then your search ends here . Because it's battery life is better than anyone in market.Battery life - best in marketSound - not laudable but good quality soundScreen - awesome full screen displayFingerprint reader  - would have been great if it had screen inline touch otherwise back screen touch is also fast.Camera quality - good camera quality but best thing is its wide angel view.I was iPhone user but after looking at its feature I want to say big thanks to Samsung.

    Camera is really good. Both the front and rear camera.Display is absolutely stunning. SAMOLED display.Battery life is incredible and battery saving option works totally great. Used it for a full day and battery was still at 60% with saver on.Phone audio is crisp and nice. Performance of the phone is also very good I frequently use a bunch of apps together and play games too, it does not lag. The best thing about M31 is it's User Interface. It's clean and simple unlike other UIs like MiUi which is totally trash. There aren't any bloatwares in the phone.Overall a perfect phone 10/10.

    The phone mega monster is superb phone in this range. Here are highlighted pros & cons points.PROS:-1) Camera quality is fantastic 64 MP camera is performing great.2) Battery life is better. 6000mah is quite efficient.3)face lock and fingerprint sensor is supper fast.4) Super amoled screen provide you real experience of 4k video.CONS:-The only cons I have noticed in this phone after 20 days of use is charging is slow in comparison of other fast charging phone. But this is not a big issue for me.I feel happy with Mega Monster M31 phone.

    Phone performance detoriated within 2 months from purchase. As the memory is filled 32GB out of 128 GB available, the phone response has drastically reduced. Specifically face recognition, finger print sensing, switching between Apps etc.Also not happy with camera quality (though I'm not an expert but when I capture normal clicks without any settings, quality is not so good which we expect from a 64 MP camera)Battery performance is good till now. Easily lasts for more than a day after exhaustive usage of Web meetings, hot spot, movie etc.

The vibrant screen to the diverse camera options to the best battery life on any smartphone made this piece an awesome choice. Altogether getting it from a brand like Samsung was the best of all. . Enjoying the phone day to day . . . Quiet a Monster M31 is !!!!

    The phone has excellent build quality, supurb display and huge battery life. My battery lasts for 2 days of normal to moderate use when fully charged. Phone lacks in fast charging, it is not that fast but it get compensated by big battery life. Rear camera is also good. Front camera is decent. Colour reproduction is very good, thanks to super amoled display. Watching movies and surfing on social media is delight on this device.Overall the phone is worth the money in mid range price section.

Till now it's running very smoothly, camera quality is best in this prise segment.After using more than 3 months i recommend this phone to others also and ordered one more unit. In this price segment this is the best phone. But this time price hike is the disappointing thing...

Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone

    Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with \"6000 mAh\" monster battery, superb \"64 MP Quad Camera\", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

It cost me 15,999 rupees.Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.

    Very poor quality, phone touch stopped responding on few areas suddenly. Didn't expected this from Samsung. I am not able to use from a month.. :(Tried connecting customer service and they asked to go service center when it opens after lockdown. On asking whether my warranty period would be extended due to this, they completely denied.. I am feeling cheated now. :((Don't buy this phone !!

    It's been only a few days of purchase.  So far the experience is good. My usage is minimal for basic emails, social media chats, picture sharing etc. Very less usage for voice/video calls as well. No gaming. Battery seems to last three days easily on one full charge.What makes me proud to own this device is that in all the years I have owned a cell phone, this is the first time I am holding a \"Made in India\" device. Proud of that . Will post an update later based on future experience

    It's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it. I would never buy crappy Xiaomi phones with its obscene notifications. Go for samsung phones, they don't push anything vulgar with their phones.

    I can't believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I'd need to pay if anything is broken. What's the warranty for? I asked what's the \"Gorilla Glass\" for if it couldn't handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, \"We are insiders. So we understand these things, there's no such thing as \"gorilla vorilla\" it's a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you'll have to pay for this.\"I can't believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this \"insider\" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.

    Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.

    Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.

    Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smoothBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expectScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decentCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp camProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.

    Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good. But looks wise the company could do better using glass or metal.Cons: no proper cover available. Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(

    This phone is the best phone which we can buy currently especially when this is coming from a brand like Samsung1. The first thing is the screen which is very crisp and clear. Love watching movies on it.2. The processor is fast and one of the best in this price range.3. The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.4. The finger print reader works well.5. The camera is really good with great output all around.All in all, it ticks all the right boxes and you are guaranteed to enjoy this phone. A very easy recommendation for all.

    After using an iphone this phone feels quite low in performance. The screen resolution is not sharp, the camera has filters but images are not sharp. A bit slow response to certain apps.Otherwise good with fingerprint response, battery life is amazing overall for the price it's good for general use.

    Pros:6GB RAM,64MP rear camera,32MP Front Camera,6000mah battery and more over Samsung is brand,Gorilla glass 3,Sound is good especially DOLBY ATMOS,AMOLED DisplayCons:Some what delay in recognizing face especially in low light conditions, Back Panel build with PlasticAnd remaining is good And you have to buy ear phones and case and Temper glass/Screen Protector.I am using phone since five days I didn't face any problems and more over that this phone will have some lags while playing pubg.So game lovers didn't like this phone I mean you will play up to medium level games but large exams like PUBG..etc you will face some lags.But except game lovers every common man like this phone and it fulfills all his needs.

    I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.PERFORMANCE : 4 starsCAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.Everything else is fine.Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.

    Pros and Cons compare to other mobiles in the same budgetPros.1. Awesome Display2. Battery Excellent3. Build quality is OK4. Camera (both front and back) is good ( not comparing with flagship mobile cams )5. Speaker sound quality is decent6. One UI is OK but it could have been better7. Processor is good and with 6GB RAM it's performance is smoothCons.1. No back cover out of the box.2. 15w charger is enough for 6000mah battery3. Camera (both front and back) in low light is not up to the mark4. There are few issue with software for example, sometimes unable to send SMS, Samsung customer took remote access but unable to find reason.hope these software issues will be fixed soon with future updatesOver all - it is a value for money.

    The Camera  performance though  boasts a 64 MP rear camera and 32MP selfie camera fall short of the quality of  pictures & videos  when compared to my other mobile pictures which is  Realme Note 5pro & has 48MP rear camera. I failed to understand how Samsung could fall short to Realme even when boasting higher  specs.  Not satisfied with M31

    Fingerprint reader is awesome both in its view and working.Camera quality isnt as we can say 64 mp but the wide angle it creates and captures is awesome. Selfie camera is thumbs up.Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*

    I had previously used Note 5, S8, and Note 9 before switching to M31. Foremost reason was massive battery life, which has proved right.Forget daily charging. Even with heavy use, phone will be on for more than 2 days without any charging.Rest are too perfect... camera for daily use, looks, balance, screen vividness...Finally do not go for Vivo or Xiomi or Realme etc. Buy this phone and never regret.

Battery lasts 10hour 30 minutes of continuousgaming, video playback, etc...Camera: 10/10Battery: 10/10Built quality: 9/10User interface:10/10Display:10/10Gaming: 9/10 ( medium level gaming. Better gaming experience in PUBG with medium graphic settings)Pros:-FHD+ sAMOLED display-Accurate GPS-Large 64mp samsung gw1 sensor- 32 MP Sony imx616  sensor- 6000mah batteryCons:- 15W charger takes long time to charge_  Glossy polycarbonate body get  scratched easily.

    I prefer Samsung than any Chinese brand mobile because I believe it's more reliable and trusted brand.M31 is having good display, camera is good, and awesome battery backup. Only  issue I found with this mobile is it takes a long time to charge about 2 hours, so having 6000mAh is not effective unless you keep it at charge on night (the reason for 4 star).

    Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it's M series of smartphones.Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.Rating: 5 of 5.Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.Rating: 5 of 5Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it's awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that's normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it's ok at this price point.Rating: 5 of 5Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.Sound: 4 of 5Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can't be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.Rating: 4 of 5.Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word \"Excellent\". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.Rating: 5 of 5Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.Rating: 5/5Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.

    Pros:1.Battery 6000 mAh- good to last for 2 days with moderate use. (I am not a gamer)2. Camera- good at day light shots(front & back). Definitely need improvement at low light conditions. Same camera performes better than this at Realme& Redmi.3.Display- Super Amoled- best4. It does not feel too heavy even though with 6000 mAh battery.5. Android 10- Samsung's One UI2. Latest with great GUI.6. Finger print sensor- fast with great response.Cons:1.Exynos 9611 processor - average. Not meant for gamers.2. Plastic back.3. Charging- ~2.5 hrs to fuel the battery full4.Focus hunting- While recording video camera struggles to focus. You feel it only when viewed on big screens.

    Galaxy M31 sports a rectangular camera module at the back in the top left corner. The camera setup comprises three camera sensors and an LED flash. There is a fingerprint scanner in the middle, followed by the Samsung branding at the bottom. Upfront, there is a waterdrop notch at the top and fewer bezels. The chin has a 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and speaker grille (from left to right). The head doesn’t have anything. The left side of the smartphone is home to a SIM slot and the left side houses the volume rocker and the power on/off button. Speaking of the volume button, it is placed quite high and reaching it wasn’t as easy as it is on any other smartphone.The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch.The M31 is Samsung’s cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There’s plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it’s no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won’t have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.

In final words Samsung give you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.In third Photo, You see Software Details.In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot.Samsung M31 not support Knox Security.Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.<U+0001F92A><U+0001F608>

    Newly purchased samsung m31 quite satisfied with the phone. In fact, loving this #MegamonsterThings to know before buyingM31 offers One UI 2.0 (based on Android 10) which is out-of-the-box.A smooth Android skin, it works well on most Samsung smartphones and has a few nifty features – Always-On Display, Ultra Data Saving, and Dual Messenger – that add to the package.6.4 full hd Super Amoled display is just Amazing which I couldn't find in other phones in this segment. It gives an enriched experience while watching Netflix or prime. It supports 4K as well.The colours are vibrant and punchy and the text is sharp and  the sunlight legibility is also quite good.It has a 6000mah mega monster battery which I love the most. Easily it last for 1.5 or 2 days. And it takes 2.5 hours or less for full charging. Trust me I use my phone for around 12-15 hours a day. With this monstar battery, phone doesn't seem heavyweight. Well done! SamsungThe Samsung Galaxy M31 consists of a 64-megapixel primary sensor, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a 5-megapixel macro sensor, and a 5-megapixel depth camera, which produce great results in day-time. The images captured by the 64-megapixel sensor have good details and great dynamic range32 MP selfie camera is amazing.It supports slow motion, live focus as well Overall phone is awesome. If looking for a phone under 15000, I would suggest this is best phone in the market with samsung brand value.

    Hi,I would like to bring this to your notice that I had Purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) Sm-M315FZKGINS worth  Rs.15,999.00 on 5th of March 2020 from Amazon Prime Account which was Sold by STPL Exclusive Online and got was delivered on 7th March 2020.The Samsung M31 seems to be fake product, its not even a month the phone has stopped working completely. It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.

    For office goers , home makers, I would say this is the best phone with best specification from a well known brand. I am writing this review after 5 days of decent use. Battery can survive for 2 days easily even with decent data usage. No heating issue. 64 MP Camera and video quality is so good like a flagship phone. Without a cover, the phone is too slippery to handle. Wide angle camera quality is okay but I don't use it frequently so it is not a big compromise. Selfie camera with 32 MP is a good trade off. No lag or delay in graphics, the transition is too smooth. Gorilla glass 3.0 is very helpful. Speaker sound and quality is very decent enough. Great Audio quality while using this M31 with bluetooth headset especially with \"Dolby Atmos\" effect on, which I didn't expect. I was planning to buy M30S, but after knowing the launch of M31, I was waiting for 15 days to book this one. Having a 64 MP camera phone would definitely need a 128 GB storage to store your beautiful memories. Worth buying, go for it.

    I had bought two M31 in same order, one was ok and was performing up to the mark but, the another one had a big hardware malfunctioning. The product was very good in look and I started using it but as soon as I made a call from it, there was no sound. No outgoing sound, no incoming sound, no ringtone sound. Then I checked volumes in settings panel, but all volumes were on high. So I played a song but again no sound. I opened YouTube and played a video; to mu surprise, the video was running in fast forward. I checked speed of video, but it was normal; still videos were playing in fast forward mode and jumping 5 seconds at a time. Again, no sound was there.I called Amazon technician, and he assisted me over phone, but after marathon talk of 1.5 hours with him, he allowed me to return/replace product, and I returned it back.While writing this, the another piece which I bought together, is running very well.

    The camera is not THAT good.. I mean the way they show it in the ads. But then again, at this price,  it's acceptable. The phone should have come with a cover cuz the metallic finish makes it slippery. The hardcover I ordered with it was of no use. I had exchanged my previous phone and got almost Rs. 5000 off  and I immediately regretted it as a lot of tools/in built functions do not exist in this phone. The only good thing which still is debatable is the battery I guess. I wish I had bought some other phone instead.

    Hey Everyone! Its almost upto 5 days i have been using this Flagship smartphone SAMSUNG GALAXY M31(6GB/64GB). My experience is amzing with this phone. Everything is working properly(FingerPrint sensor and other biometric locks) Camera is very clear and is making photos very stable. The most most most amazing feature in this phone is its battery life<U+0001F463> Even if after operating this phone for hours, playing games and using many other battery conusming apps it only falls by 10% or 15%. Best for gaming, it never overheats and no lag & bug observed!In comparison with other Smart Phones it is best budgetary phone till now on Amazon<U+0001F607>Grab this deal ASAP and have a good day!<U+2764>Thankyou for your Precious Time<U+0001F60A>Stay Safe <U+0001F4AF>

    I bought this phone on Day 1 of Sales. Excited, but Excitement didn't last long.2nd Day started seeing issues like it hangs a lot, becomes non-responsive for almost 10 min and has to force restart every time. So requested for replacement. Got replacement after a couple of days, hoping this would not be defective.This also started hanging on the first day itself. I think its a software issue.It suddenly becomes non-responsive, you can hear calls coming in, but can't receive them, the screen becomes off, it won't turn on for the next 10 min or more. I have missed many calls like this.On the paper, the specs and price are absolutely amazing. Now I realize why the phone is sold at lower prices.Please let me know if any of you also faced the same issues.

    Nice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung.

    The camera quality is really exciting with 64 MP quad camera capturing almost all details. The macro and wide angle options makes it outstanding for this price. However, sometimes when required to take fast actions, focus is being lost. Autofocus is not so quick as well.  32 MP front camera is a beast!!!The smoothness of display and screen is highly appreciable and commendable and this will be the best in this price range.Finger print reader should have been onscreen and the case could be ceramic or metalic which are being offered by other manufacturers for this price or lower.Eventhough it is claimed to be 6000 mAh, draining of battery is quick and you need to recharge once in a day.Unexpected crash of apps is also observed within one week of time.

    Yesterday I received one. Very gooddesign to carry. It seems light weight.I was little disappointed with packaging because brown box packing was not proper so we felt that may be somebody tried to replace something from the box. I was little disappointed when not found Head Phones inside box in Samsung Product. Camera quality is good. Overall very good battery life, fully satisfied

    I would say this is the best smartphone at around 15000 rupees .6000mAh battery is its USP. I watched two movies online back to back and still 60% of battery was available. With fast charging 6000mah battery takes a bit time but that is reasnable. 64 MP camera is mind blowing with for different types of camera you can click different  quality images. Its been two days I have bought this phone and surely I am in love with it. 6GB RAM is enough to play any mobile game like ping or free fire or any other.

    Tha Galaxy M31 is probably the greatest piece of design & engineering excellence by the Global Smartphone leader -Samsung for its new/repeat purchase Galaxy users.Having used the M31 for 5 days now I would love to share my user experience. Every aspect of this phone is unique, the hardware, software and the OS has been engineered par excellence and over delivers on its promise and commitment.For non Galaxy users possibly this is the best possible opportunity to own this powerhouse phone at such an appealing price point.Kudos to the Amazon India Team for the Product Management, planning, sales, marketing & logistics support rendered with before time delivery of this amazing product.

    Don't buy this rubbish phone ever samsung is now going on same china way thay are cheating with customers. Battery only 3000 mh instead of 6000 mh it's automatically darin out in one night. Camera so poor as comparison of other phones. So please don't buy .

    My views may change over time, but as of now not happy with battery backup or charging time.I was switching from xiaomi to Samsung as my company apps dont support xiaomi.But so far not happy with supposedly fast charging of Samsung.My MI Note 4 that is 3 years old charges faster than this brand new phone.Also my old MI Note 4 phone that is just 4000 Mah had power backup for 2 days initially when I bought it.I don't see any improvement in the new 600Mah phone with same set of apps installed. Not sure where the extra2000Mah charge is wasted

    I bought this as it was completing my smartphone specification needs.Loved camera and audio quality when I use video recording.From my point of view getting sAMOLED and 64 MP quad camera setup at this price point is a steal deal.When it comes to some more needful things, I would love it if it comes with in display fingerprint reader and charging adapter with more output for fast charging because it takes time to charge massive 6000 mAh battery which I took one or one and half day to drain after office uses and PUBG session.Talking about design it feels sleek and premium because of shiny finish.

    Excellent phone in budget. I used M30s previously I am not satisfied with camera on M30s. That has been taken care in this M31 and even the speed on the phone is also improved.This has the latest android which is a plus. You can tight away but this phone. Forgot to mention battery, super battery with more than 1 and half day backup.

    Have been using M31 for a week now.It is everything you need from a <U+20B9>15000 phone.-An amoled display showing accurate colors.-Exceptionally large battery, can easily go through a day even with wifi on.- It has a good solid built quality .- Best thing about this phone is its camera. Which produces accurate colors and take amazing pictures.Will recommend this to anyone who wishes to spend this much on a mid range phone.In comparison to other brands I chose samsung beacuse of Samsung's deliverance of a quality product and good chain of serivce centres across my state.

    Good Phone in this budget. Camera quality is awesome. Plenty of options to click the pics in live focus,pro mode, night mode. Very handy and the blue color is good. On the battery side, currently getting backup more then 1 day. Let see in coming days. 6 GB RAM with 128GB memory. Usually disadvantage of Samsung mobile is that it gets hung after some days.. But need to see in this mobile with 6 GB ram.. As of now NO hanging ..Overall Good mobile to buy in this budget. If People of bored of mi,honor and other mobiles.. I suggest to go with this mobile..

    Samsung M31 i have received on Monday and i can proudly say that its a very good mobile within this price. I was very much confused as samsung was offer 6GB ram along 128GB in this price range with  6000mAH battery, but after using this mobile i am happy to own this mobile. Look & feel, interface while using mobile, battery backup, speed, finger print sensor and available usable RAM approx 3.2 GB (after loading most of apps) will give you a WOW experience. In 16k budget i an finally say its a very good phone.

    Samsung M31 automatically restarts.. ram  processor is worst.. i have had a very bad experience of this phone.. phone slows down a bit then it hangs and which results in automatic restarting the phone.. bcoz of this i loose my data or the things I was working on.. i have been facing this bad experience since first day I received my mob.. initially i thot that some update might be coming .. but then lockdown began and I was unable to reach customer service centre. I hope Samsung will look into the matter at the earliest and provide a appropriate solution for the same..

Android 10 UI customized by Samsung has a classy seamless flow.5. Face recognition speed is impressive.6. Smart pop up notification is useful.Cons:1. Low light camera is not up to the mark.2. Auto focus snapping is disturbing.3.On-Screen Finger print sensor would have been better than the one on back side.

    After 60 days:Great deal in this price range, especially for those who love watching videos and who enjoy music a lot and also who travel a lot.Camera is good.Battery: Without a shadow of a doubt, it's a monster. I was concerned about its charging speed; but after using this almost for a week, it doesn't bother me. It takes around 2hr30min.I'm not a big fan of games. I've been playing \"hill climb racing 2\" which shows stutter problem almost each time. Not happy about that :(Needs better optimization.

    Just a basic phone.  If you have a fix budget below 15k, u may go for it.  Samsung has tried to make fool the customers with the pre launch specifications about this model. I never prefer Chinese phones, but after seeing this Samsung phone, I can surely say Oppo Vivo RealMe and RedMe are much more better than this. Cameras are like dummy tiny glasses. All other specifications are only in written. <U+263A><U+FE0F>

Both the front and rear cameras take phenomenal photos in presence of adequate light. Not very suitable for low light photography.In short, this budget phone is an excellent value for money.

Also the front camera is very good.Have smooth performance while playing games like PUBG. Also have 6000 mAh battery  so you can play games, movies etc. for a long time. So overall it's a very good phone in this price range than other brands. Also no unnecessary ads issues with other brands, have very clean and nice UI without any unnecessary preinstalled apps.

Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price.

    I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

    1.Camera - 3.8/52.Performance - 3.0/53.Battery backup - 2.7/5(Battery doesnot prove itself as 6000mah)Charge time is quiq agreed.But,drains fast.Feels like the capacity is 4000mah.My reivew im submitting after a week of observed usage.My major point on selecting this mobile was battery.........They assured 6000mah but the fact is i can just get 4000mah worthfullness.If ur just looking for 6000mah battery mobile this is the worst choice.Badly feel like cheated by samsung.

    Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

    Awesome  screen .Awesome battery  .Awesome  cameras .Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .

    I am a tech guy and this review is genuine. First of all Samsung is the baap of mobiles..coming to m31 I waited so long to buy and saw many reviews.lets start from positive..1. Camera is awesome both front and back. Picture clarity in zoom is good2. Very smooth finish of mobile which looks really great3. Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MIComing to negative pointsall reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.Loud speaker is not so efficient.Normal sound is goodAs its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained

    I brought this phone because of camera and battery. Battery is fine but i expected more from camera the details of camera is poor when you zoom the image even 4x digital and optical. Recently i broughted m30s 2 weeks ago and it has some issues so i returned it and i am telling you there is no major upgrade on rare 64mp camera mode. It's almost look like m30s 48mp photos. I watched many youtubers saying this is the best camera with this price but i think it needs importants because when i zoom in after taking a image its details are gone its look like 2mp image. But i think Samsung can fix this problem with software upgrade and overall this phone is good and also I don't know why they bother giving a macro camera , it's pathetic it's can't get too close and the details are pathetic link 0.5 mp . And if samsung fix this issue with update i will update my review.Phone model no: SM-M31F/DS

    Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy. We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.

    Excellent product..the specifications of this phone are truly amazing and not just on paper , the performance  of the phone doesn't let you down at any instant. The fingerprint reader is quick to respond and has no delay in unlocking the phone.  The camera is the highlight of this phone which allows users to capture splendid pictures (64MP) I myself have clicked numerous  pictures and haven't  faced any issues with the camera. The battery  life of this phone is more than adequate  for daily usage as well as gaming(performs well while running heavy games also). I'm extremely  pleased with the product and would recommend  this phone to anyone  looking for a smooth and hassle free experience.

    Positives:Great battery lifeNice screen, thank you amoledConvenient features, fast connectivity (Bluetooth, wifi)Has not frozen once. No software issues yetNegatives:Face recognition and finger print recognition are iffy.Front facing camera is not sharp at all. Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcamSamsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price pointStill, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.

    Battery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.

    I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.I want to explain it's some feature as below1stly Battery 5star2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.3rd Front camera - 4star.4th Processor - 4star5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4starThese all ratings are out of 5.Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..

    Awesome phone..I am writing  this review after using  the phone after more than 1 month. Both rear  and front camera is awesome  and quality of picture is good..it suport 4K videos..I am bit disappointed  on battery quality and charging ponit..It is not up to the mark on 6000mAh battery..It takes 3-4 hr to charge the full battery  and discharge within a day.If you will play game,it will discharge withi  10 hr.I am not playing games much,so I am satified but I won't support to buy this phone if you paly games all most of the time in a day.Also I am not happpy  on face recognition..I feel as It doesn't  support sometime..But overall it is a good phone.

    Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.Overall it's a very good phone.

    Now firstly for the pubg lovers I would like to tell you that it easily runs pubg at HDR ultra settings of graphics with no lag you just need to activate performance mode which obviously uses more battery give best performance.The phone has three battery modes by default it will be in performance mode ,( takes as much juice possible from your battery to handle your heavy tasks, multitasking, etc. And once you it last easily 2 days. Cameras are awesome it's a bit warmer and soft images but details are amazing and other colours.....Guys literally there are loads of features and don't want to write an essay over here it will be tedious for you all to read....Trust me I'm using it as my daily driver and had no issues ya it may not have 90Hzs but who needs it in day to day budget life. Don't think just go for it and you enjoy it phone ...... #bestbudgetphone...

    Phone is good. Value for money, but sound quality is not good. While playing Facebook,Youtube and other MX Player or internal video's it's not getting sound. If I restart then phone then its sounding. I'm facing oftenly but it's not resolved yet. And Wifi hotspot is not working properly while connecting to desktop or Laptop. But its connecting to mobiles. I raised for exchange phone, let's see what will happen. But I never expects this type of problems by SAMSUNG. Really upset....!!

    The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a dissappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.

    I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....Pro:1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.7. Price.Cons:1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protection<U+0001F642>.

    Battery life is better than others but still it cannot stand for two days with regular internet usage.Camera is quality is great.  But using wide angle view stretches the image and distorts the faces as well .Big space makes life easier.Fingerprint sensor could be more sensitive.Just missed a wow review due to little things but Overall this mobile justifies its cost.

    coming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.

    This is the best mobile phone under Rs  20,000. My detailed review after a week of usage.1. Battery life - This phone has full day battery life. I don't have a television and mobile phone is my only source of entertainment. So you can imagine my usage pattern. I used to charge my old phone two times a day but not this beast. Easily runs through the day with maximum usage including moderate.l GPS navigation and high brightness.2. Display - Again no other brand can dare to compare. Not even iphone. Best display. Keeping this one short because i am short of words for this display.3. User Interface - Everything on point. One UI 2.0 is a treat to operate. Using samsung phone after a long time and it feels great to be back home after using MIUI ( xiaomi ) , EMUI ( Huawei ) and one plus. UI has all the important features and perfect placement to make it highly efficient and usefull. Screen transitions are joyful. Smoothness of another level. Feels like butter flowing under my fingers.4. Camera - I have attatched few sample images where you can really appreciate the amount of detail this beast can capture. 64 MP shots are crystal clear with very level of detail.Again i am short of words to explain the camera. Simply best camera phone under Rs 20,000. While all other brands keep explaining how you can use pro mode to make it intresting but in this phone you can simply point and shoot and results are always interesting. Also there is pro mode and many other modes if you still need them.I have become a fan of this phone and a fan of samsung.No negative points so far , i will keep updating this review in future if i find anthing good or bad.

Blue light protector can be enabled to protect our eyes from harmful blue Rays emerge out of phones4. Average processor but ok5. Definitely a monster at this price rangeCons1. Mobile gets heated up bit while using camera and other apps continously. Also, during software update2. Full Mobile charging 1%-100% takes up to 2.5hrs for full charging as the charger is15w fast charger and not 25w charging like in other phones.Overall rating 4 and 1 star less for above cons.However,  an extraordinary mobile at this price range with a great brand SAMSUNG. Blindly,  go for it your budget is less than 15k

    Likes:1. Battery is good.2. Camera appears good, though I haven't yet observed/used it keenly.Dislikes:1. The width of the handset is less than the optimal, making typing difficult due to the jumbling of alphabet in the portrait mode.2. System heats up even during the simple applications.3. It even hangs down while using simpler applications.4. The overall software is not user friendly, making simpler things complex.5. Not at par with Redmi phones. My Redmi Note 4 was better than it in many respects.6. The seller is casual and not competent enough as the packaging was quite imperfect for the phone. The phone box was simply kept in a big cardboard box alongwith some other item, without any cushioning. The seller should be blacklisted by Amazon.Redmi Note 8 Pro is a better option. I Regret for buying it.

    The product is handy, the display is very good and so is the battery.But don't expect too much from the 6000 mAH battery. The features are great and the sensors work good.Sound:Sound is loud but clear. You wont be needing to attach it to a speaker when indoors. There is a special Dolby Effect for speakers which you probably should give a try. It is great.Biometrics:Phone is supported with Finger print scanner and Face unlock. And these are surprisingly fast as compared to its prior versions.Apps:Most apps are supported but some utility app like Samsung Pay etc is not yet supported by the phone. Please work on it.Gaming:So far so good. I have tried out pubg and Asphalt. The games work flawless and phone doesn't heat up as expected.9.5/10 for overall performance10/10 at this price rangeYou can definitely go forward and get your hands on it.

    The Samsung Galaxy M31 is decently and simply designed when it comes to budget smartphones. There isn’t too much going on but whatever we have on our plates is still eye-pleasing. When I first held the Galaxy M31, it appeared quite bulky. But as it adjusted to my hands I got to know it was lightweight after all. Made up of polycarbonate, the device comes in two colour options: Ocean Blue and Space Black. I got hold of the black colour and loved the classic black tone of the device, which can never go wrong for a smartphone or anything painted in black. Although the smartphone doesn’t have a glass back, it doesn’t come last in the design race and offers us a sleek, not-so-cheap, and sturdy design.The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch. It is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is slightly disappointing. The smartphone has a number of display features, which are mostly in the case of every Samsung smartphone. There is Adaptive Brightness, Blue light filter, Dark mode, a choice between Vivid and Natural display colours, Always On Display, Accidental touch protection, Touch Sensitivity and more. While all the display features prove to be helpful, the accidental touch protection doesn’t really provide any protection as the device could easily be accessed accidentally.Finally I will suggest others to buy this mobile because of the excellent functionality and features

    Hello peoples, I have purchased this M31 Last month 18 March, am totally upset due to Samsung M31 because of more gaps in this M31. I will tell problem -> 1. Macro camera ( in ad they show small boat photo very clearly from a distance but actually it not like that.2. Only they additional  camera and increase the mega pixel.Additional macro camera totally waste.3. Battery - 6000MA ok , when I put charge it take 4 to 5 hrs for full charge.When i compare to my moto g3 it take 2hrs only for full charge in normal charge. Charging time  it take too much of time , it waste.4. Mobile security, actually I interest in A50S for two main reason one for NFC and other one KNOX Security.in M30 I don't know actually condition.But I had review Spec of M31 in GSMARENA ,NFC is available depend on market,I saw many review none one not say about NFC they not no about that.Due to KNOX Security, NFC, Battery charging time, Macro camera it totally  upset my mind on the first day of my purchase it self.If any development in exist mobile model kindly do some improvement.Positive point , 6GB ram It working well.

    First of all I will tell you about this product after using 1 week...1. Coming to the bettery part.. this product has very good battery performance.. battery capacity is 6000mah..2. I loved display of this product.. display is very very good... see the picture of that display.. i loved it.. this display is sAmoled.. for this price.. this is good.3. Comming to the Samsung UI.. SAMSUNG has very good UI compared to other brand...it just feel smooth perfomance...4. There are 64mp main camera.. and 8mp ultrawide camera.. and 5mp macro camera and 5mp depth camera... obviously 64mp provide very sharp images.. but while using this lens.. we can't zoom in... ultra wide camera is good... macro camera also good..5. As we know Samsung has its own processor Exynos... this exynos processor has little power consuming processor as compared to snapdragon... but this exynos has very good AI about camera...I couldn't find any drawback of this product at this level.. after using 1 month. i will update my review.. thank you

    Yesterday I got stucked when I was using keyboard..I have to restart the mobile...anyhow after this I didn't get any problem.Front camera is not much butter as compare to other mobile 32 mega pixel comera.The image getting blured when zooming  the image.Rear camera is good.All sensors are working as expected.Some features must be implement which I didn't find in this mobile like -1. Internet speed status bar on the top of the screen.2. Daily data usage should be visible inside the top scroll bar It will help the user to limit the daily data use otherwise he went to know only when he spend 50% or 90% through sim card notification.Battery life is good and we are able user it more longer time as compare to other mobiles.I love the screen quality of this mobile.I got some new features in this mobile which are really  very helpful. Thanks Samsung!!!!!!

    So i have been using this phone extensively  for 4 days I decided to buy this phone as I consume a lot of YouTube content so screen and battery life was important to me so I chose this phone moreover something strange with this phone is that it gives me up to 1mbps speed on my jiofi(I live basically in middle of a forest..so that's great for me ) and cellular quality is top notch and the UI is just awesome also camera is top notch and all sensors are superbTo talk about cons sinc it uses exynos 9611 chipset u cannot expect a great gaming experience u can still game at high graphic setting but with mild frame drops I have tried pubg, asphalt 9 etc on this on medium settings this phone works like charmSo overall this phone is a great buy if u are stepping from other brands(previously was using a note 7 pro) but not a good upgrade as compared to M30s(almost similar)So happy shopping

    The product is wisely good to use daily tasks run smoothly.. app transitions were smooth . No stuttering or legs.  Display takes it all..crisp and clear with viewing angles...too good. Was so amazed by the camera picture quality . Decent pics lowlight pics were good too. Only con is the phone gets lil hot just below the selfie cam..if used for more than 10 min or on call . One ui is decent way better than touchwiz. Bloatware can be removed or disabled. Over all good phone from Samsung gives tight competition to other phones in the same price bracket. Monster battery the name says it all..more than one day or close to 2 days it can last.. gaming is smooth with lil frame drops..

    So I'm using this device from more than 2 months..and I can say it's definitely not that a phone which I can call a brilliant one ..battery life is good camera is good..Fingerprint is okay but will not work if your finger is a bit wet..but overall it's good for me..No issues of hang-up...and yes with no doubt its samsung and you can go for it..

    I am giving 4/5 stars, one star less for not having folder lock feature.I like this phone, it's working smooth like butter, it's camera, battery, processor are great and it is handling multitasking pretty well, it has great battery backup too. I am not a pro gamer so for me it's more than sufficient for daily working.The only cons with this phone is that it is not having folder lock or app lock feature. To get his feature, we have to install third party app. Providing folder lock in this phone would have added more security features for users.

    Just an average phone...phone can't handle on its own the software glitches unlike Mi & Asus phones.A system update made the phone dead and now I want to return the product and buy a different phone given the lockdown situation in the country and all its service centres closed.Please suggest what should be done?Updated review:- stars updated from 3 to 4.The samsung team responded well and recovery of my dead phone was made possible. Phone is working pretty ok since then except the battery unit in it. The battery efficiency has fallen since then.Had the problem not happened, this phone deserved a generous 5 star. <U+0001F44D>

    As a mountain  guide I always go for  a phone  with  a big batteries, since  there  is limited  chance to find  wall sockets.  So I found  this phone perfect do those  who live  off the grid's.  Plus  the camera it takes  perfect photograph,, thanks to Samsung now I don't  have  to carry  my bulky  DSLR every time  I go to an expedition. Above  are the  two main features I have  been  looking from a smartphone, screen  visibility  was also great when I was at glacier. Samsung  should transform this phone  into a Rugged  smartphone. And one more thing,  Image stabilizer during  video capture  was amazingly  smooth.Thanks SamsungAnd thanks  Amazon  for its super fast  delivery.

    I bought the mobile on March and have been using for the past 3 months.. I am a tehnological addict who would keep on changing mobile once in 6 months... Previously I was using Oppo F11 and  being unsatisfied with the specs of that model, I bought this device.. I am extremely happy about this device as the phone is really superb and an excellent choice for normal and heavy usage.. Battery back up is massive and no need to worry even if you play heavy graphics games and You don't need to carry a power bank or charger even if you happen to halt in a place for 2 days .. Display and Camera quality are awesome and comparatively better than other mobiles at this price segment.. My friend is using iPhone 7 plus and he is asking my m31 as exchange to his iPhone...I really love the Pixel and display clarity.. You can blindly buy the mobile without any negative thought...

    The phone is 100% value for money but it would have been far better if the Samsung had used good built quality. The finger print reader is working fine. There are so many modes in camera which I think is so cool for clicking pictures and the camera quality is much better. Well you are getting a 6000mAH battery in this one, one shouldn't be complaining about the battery life atleast. The  cons of this phone is that Samsung should have given a higher watt fast charger which is only 15 watt fast charging and the back side of the phone gets scratches all over it if you  clean the phone with a soft cotton cloth only. The backside would have been much better if they have used glass. All over the phone is best in this price range.

    I bought one week back. The product is flawless. Build quality is good,amoled display make it equal to flagship version. Go for 64 GB if u already have SD card. If you already have Samsung phone you can easily transfer everything through samsung smart switch feature.Battery holds good if you don't use this phone as hotspot all the time.Touch sensors are good and speakers are fine.Do not have any complaints so far except keyboard input seems lags at time hopefully some updates in future fixes it.15k worth mobile n its worth it!!

    The Galaxy M31 turned out to be the most value-for-money budget phone from the Korean giant.Samsung has once again focused on battery capacity as one of the highlights. The Galaxy M31 has a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, the biggest we’ve ever seen on any Galaxy phone, no matter which price segment it may fall in. The other notable feature on the M31 is a 64MP primary rear camera.The Galaxy M31 also comes with a number of other camera features, like AR Emoji, Super Slow-mo video recording, a regular slow motion mode, and a Super Steady mode that uses the ultra-wide cameras to record action camera-like videos with reduced shake.I love it .Thanks Samsung and Amazon

    Ok first of all.1.Do not buy the phone as they have mentioned 6000Mah Mega Battery.The battery works just half a day and is so normal. It's not even fast charging.2.Do not even think of a good front camera.3. The charger is not a fast charger.Do not go for this for 16k.4. Rest some of the features are okie.5. Would be better if I get refund.

It take 2.5 hrs to full battery from 0% to 100%.You can buy this phone for battery life only.If you think about camera then plz go another mobile.In short -•Battery = 5/5•Rear Camera = 1/5 (64 MP)•Selfie canera= 4/5•fingerprint  = 4/5•Screen view = 4/5Finally  price is high of this specification phone.Price should be capped rs. 12999/- .Samsung and Amazon shame on you.

    Phone is very good to use. Camera is really is awesome. M31 is really worth a try at this cost. It has variant features. So lets talk about pros and consPros1.Camera- When I compared it with S10, M31 is superb2.Battery-Lasts almost 2days of general use for completecharge3.Display- Refreshin rate is really good and no laggingCons1. Processor - They could have improved the processor. The only drawback i find in samsung phone is that heating issues.2. Speaker - speaker is not upto a great effect3. Fingerprint - They could have launched with in display sensorWithout these cons the really awesome and its a megamonster

    Overall, good phone in its price bracket. Stand out features would be Super Amoled screen and massive battery which lasts day and a half with more than normal use. Samsung brand backing is an added advantage. Camera performance is very good in proper lighting conditions. No lag noticed even after loading bunch of apps. It would be interesting to see if it can give same performance after 6 months of usage.Final verdict: Go for it if you are not an heavy gamer and high quality basic requirements (screen, camera, battery) in limited budget are your priority. You will not regret your decision.

    I got damaged product.  I'm not getting battery Backup even if I'm not using my phone. Camera lens glass is damaged. It can be seen only if we observe properly.  No scratches or any Mark's are not detected but the lens cover is defective. Battery Backup is much lesser than my old phone having 3000 mah. I'm tired to return the product.  Samsung checkup app not finding my issue. I tried to contact Samsung care and Amazon service but not connecting

    I have been using this phone for a week now and so far it has been great. I would rate the features as following:1) Battery life 9.5/102) Screen 8/103) Speakers 7/104) Gaming -/10 (I don't play games and I'll  suggest you to skip this phone if gaming is your primary concern)5) Camera (both main and selfie) 6.5/10 - 10 being Pixel 4's cameraOne point I would like to add here is that though scrolling on this phone and the overall UI experience is ok most of the time, it doesn't feel very fluid. One can't expect everything from a 15k phone, I suppose.

Make sure you change the setting to 64 before click.Battery backup is phenominalGreat display you can get at this priceBlack varient is more classyFingerprint and faceunlock works flawlesslyFor me 6000 mah came 3 days for normal usageAndroid 10 and one UI 2.0 out of the box is a great plus. Software is more fluid and fast.Multitasking is very good. Samsung did a brilliant work memory management.Just go for it with closed eyes :)

    The display is top notch and the best in the price segment. It's not so heavy even though it comes with 6000mAh battery. Software feels lite and not bloated unlike other brands' phones in this price segment. The quad camera and the ocean blue give a rich look to the phone. I have used the phone outdoors for more than a day with considerable charge left.  Camera is also pretty good for taking normal and wide angle shots. Low light photos are not as good as expected but decent.

    Really a good phone compared with the other`s Brands available in the same price range and Specs. Display, camera, Finger print scanner, fast charging some of the built in features are really good. Over all good.Doesn't comes with Head phones or any other  accessories. On Samsung site its available for less(Don`t know how their delivery service will be).Battery last`s for almost 30 hrs, on normal usage, i was in the assumption that 6000mah may last for at-least 40+hrs

    6GB+128gb. It's  quiet awesome. Performance is very good. The above uploaded photos are taken in SAMSUNG Galaxy m31. In low light mode m31 is good comparing redmi note 8 pro. Battery backup is more than 24hrs including usage of Online streaming, PUBG game, calls, Facebook and whatsapp. Average battery drains per hour is 2.166% without gameplay. In this segment, this is a very good smartphone. In higher graphics of PUBG , frame is dropping off little but gameplay was very good. I don't like to be finger captured in backside because of Plastic.

    Not worth it, dont buy it. I purchase it few days back only hardly 15 days happens by looking at its battery size & specification. Battery life is really good, no doubt on it but i am facing the issue which i never thought. Its hangs, with even 6 gb ram still the device hang automatically & that too for 5-10 min & i am unable to do in that situation as battery is non removable in nowdays devices. I really wants to replace it but already 10 days pass so company will not take it back also. Think once while buying this product.

Now i'm not even able to open mobile. it is just a dummy piece now. when contacted samsung support, they didnt even help on this. During these tough times how does this company expects us to communicate without mobile.Please stop manufacturing these kind of cheap mobiles.

    Overall a good phone...Though the processor could have been better, but considering rest of the features offered I would say it's fine...It's definitely not a gaming centric phone, you can play games, but it might stutter at max settings like in PUBG.You get good cameras (macro is mostly useless to me),a great battery (lasts me a whole day on medium-heavy use) anda good display...I would say it is mostly focused towards those who watch a lot of videos...

    From galaxy grand-2 to M31, yet another benchmarked phone from Samsung. Bought it on 6th march. Amazing looks, features, fast processing of apps, camera and add-on features are simply superb splly slomotion captures, colours are so natural. And of course lastly the main reason to but this phone the #battery, the mammoth 6000mAh powerhouse is sufficient to spend up the day (even more) without any interruption for any working professional.. enjoy#befikar

    By looking at the phone you doesn't feel that great, i mean the looks are quiet decent and ok but when it comes to features and performance it's totally bang on. Super Amoled Display, Quad Camera setup with 64mp primary camera at 15k price range will not disappoint you literally it's camera is awesome and yes 6000mah battery despite having such a monster battery the phone feels very light and handy due the the plastic material used at the back which makes it less attractive than other glass back panel.

    Theres no way you wouldnt want to buy this phone. Lets talk about it in pros and cons. Pros- its massive 6000 mah battery packed along with a super amoled screen and a camera with a superior quality in its price range would definitely blow your experience to a whole other level. The only con I felt along with this device is that other companies provide at least a earphone or a mobile cover along with the handset. However this is not the case with m31 thats very sad

    This comes with allot of features in a budget of 16000. The phone gives you an amazing camera, good battery compared to other samsung smart phone, front camera iz really good. The phones comes out with a really good screen which provides a great video quality.Though, it does not have a secure folder, samsung pay feature, and many othr such deautre. Phone is definately not for gamers, it though supports games but the graphics must be set to medium.

    To keep oneself home during this Corona emergency one must have a phone with higher battery life. It does it.

The fingerprint is the best. Basically the phone reads my moods :)

    Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

    The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually

Call quality and reception is good7. No ads and the default Apps can be deletedNeutral:1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the NokiasCons:1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.2. Phone is little heavyConclusion:If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point

    I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

    I purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i've mixed feelings on it.These are my observations after single day use.1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use \"Secure Folder\". Need to install \"S Secure\" app for app lock.4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.6. OS is so smooth.7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.Update: after multiple days of regular use1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement4. Call quality isn't that great5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.Verdict: Go with this mobile if you're expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.

    My review after using the phone after 8 days of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.Pros:1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.Cons:-1. Night mode isn’t the best.2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.3. It doesn't come with earphones.4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.Conclusion:-If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.Regards,Yash

    I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints hereCamera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality

    I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.Thanks!

    Im writing this review after using it 20 days. I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...

    Honestly didn't expect this phone to be soo good. The software animations are so fluid, the camera is crazy good and the screen is obviously best in the market coz. Its Samsung's. I'm listing some pros and cons down here, be sure to read it. Also I've posted photos shot on this phone for reference.Pros:•Samsung's one UI is way better than the competition like Redmi's crappy MIUI.•The camera's are just too good, the HDR shots are amazing and the 64mp rear and 32mp front camera modes are just the cherry on top.•6000 mah battery is absolute overkill for a phone at this price.•The screen is really good, it's Amoled and can get pretty bright outdoors and pretty dim for indoors too.•The processor is really good too, enough for any task u throw on this.•Fingerprint scanner is on the back instead of in the screen thus it's faster, more reliable and better.•Amazon delivered the phone in 24 hrs with exchange so it was amazing.Cons. :•No fastcharger in the box even when it supports it, so charging to 100% takes too long.•In wide angle camera, there's no lens correction like in Samsung's Hughes end phones so photos look weird at the corners(I've uploaded a wide angle photo for reference).•phone can get a little bit hot while gaming, but not crazy hot so it's fine.•The 64mp photos are not that crisp so I just stick to normal camera mode.

    The camera and display are excellent.  I am absolutely fine using a regular fingerprint reader , as midrange indisplay fingerprint reader sucks in midrange samsung phones.Battery life is decent,  you csn leave a lot of things turned on.The phone takes a lot of time to boot up , not sure why.Charging is pretty slow compared  other quick charging Samsung phones.

    Excellent product by Samsung at this price point. Worth every penny you spend. 64mp camera is awesome, it really takes some stunning photos. SAmoled screen is crisp and clear. Battery performance for moderate usage for someone like me can work 2days.I am using Redmi note 7 pro from last 1 year, but this is certainly best in terms of performance as compared to Mi phones.Finger print reader is also fast. The SAR value of this phone is also very low (0.3) as compared to other high value phones. Without any doubts this is the best budget phone right now in the market.

    The look of the phone is amazing! Its sleek and looks prettier than a lot of more expensive phones.. however the face unlock is not sensitive, it doesn’t unlock if youre wearing glasses at all! The battery seems good enough but i haven’t used it for very long so can’t really say. What I’m most disappointed with is that it doesnt come with headphones!!

    At this price it will be a very good phone who has using other brands. Please find the below after using 5 days:Pros:1. Good camera quality, we can feel the change of picture.2. Battery life is awesome as of now. It is giving more than a day.3. Touch screen is very sensitive and I loved it while typing.4. Automatic light mode, which is very  good option and it as acting as per need based on our adjustments on timely basis.5. Optins wise also it has many features that we can enable  for the smart usage.6. Quality of sound is awesome.... feel like we are in theater. Have DolbyAtmos option to change the sound effect. It depends on how you feel it.Cons:1. Vedio of the quality not that much  expected. Not sure there might  be some configurations. Not checked as of now.2. Feeling little heat when we are on the sim card net. Also when we are on calls l, even this  also may be initially.Finally with the above pros and cons we can buy it wth out comparing other products which are available on the market.Thank you.

    I bought the phone for the sole purpose of processing power and camera. Processing power is really great and so does the 6000mAh battery. But camera is really disappointing. You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras. Phone has lag for some of the heavy apps but it eventually nullify soon you start using it daily. I would say if you are buying this phone for camera then DON'T please

I loved this phone and everyone should read this review and should buy this mega monster.Pros:1. Good camera2. Big battery (Even it lasts 3 days and for standby it may lasts for 5 to 6 days)3. Big storage4. Super amoled display is lit.5. For gaming its beast(PUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop.)6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category.Cons:1. Slightly heats up while charging.I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.

So this is having it at the back and it's just amazing.6) Headphone jack is avaliable7) Fast charging is really fast <U+0001F609>Cons:1) Phone heats up quickly while charging and when used continuously for above 30-35 mins2) The touch could have been a little more smoother i.e. Less resistive3) User Interface is quite complex, took 2-3 days to completely get aquanted with it

    I faced problems from day one. When I opened the box and was trying to charge the phone adapter was not working. 2nd day I went to service centre and they replaced the adapter. Battery is drying fast while it is 6000 mah. I thought there is some issue with the new phone but due to lockdown I did not went to service centre for battery problem. I am facing issue every time sometime it is restarting suddenly, due to lockdown will Amazon exchange my phone with the new one or Service Centre will replace my phone. I do not want this phone it will create lots of technical problem in future. So please replace the phone.

    Hi,  my name is ranjith,  living in chennai and work as civil engineer,  thanks to make a valuable  chance for give a feedback about the  grand master M31, I didn't expect this much of best futures in grand monster galaxy M31,  bcus the camera quality for both front and back was awesome and unbeatable as compare to other mobiles with in a limit prize.Battery backup was so good,  i did a charge last 2 days before but still my mobile have 35%.Video quality for supporting all HD content  videos,  are best to seen with high quality and dolby atmis 360° surrounding sound.Highly secured with finger print censore.Android 10.0 and one UI 2.0  was performed good with out hanging eventhough while use large file autocadd,  primavera,  stadd pro soft wares.It retains the same super AMOLED display,  exynos 9611 SoC and long - lasting 6000?mAh battery. There's also a small waterdrop notch on the display. However,  when you watch movies or play games on the device,  the Infinity -V display on the device doesn't distract.Although still great at handling basic of daily use,  and even good at handling multitasking.The company has  essentially upgraded the cameras to offer a higher resolution  64MP sensor and quad camera setup. Good photo quality in daynightThe sumsung Galaxy  M31 comes with a familiar design.The galaxy m31 also carries  on the good work with phone's camera  system  which is quite impressive for the price...The ultra-wide lens on the device  makes the phone more versatile at clicking different tyoes of shots.  5 megapixel macro lens for close up shot we found to be quite good0

    Though I was apprehensive to buy this phone after using my previous One Plus 5 for the last 3 yrs yet I  must say that this by far the best decision I have made in the month! #M31 is a monster rightly as highlighted in their ads constantly. Few of my friends were chosen to give the first reviews and I am glad I believed them!The 64 mega pixel camera is fantastic and has a good AI attached to it because it can differ food objects and nature pretty vividly. The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too. Though the charging scene is a bit slow but it's okay to give that time off to the phone once in two days.I chose the 128 Gb option since I have a bundles of data to carry and the phone is clearly standing up to my expectations in the last 10 days.

    I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of <U+20B9>14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use nowWhat i liked:-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.-Android 10 & One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.What I didn't like-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.

    After 5 days of usePros1) prompt finger print and face authentication. Face recognition is too fast.2)Camera quality natural. Quard camera +64 Mega pixel is the best.3) Gigantic battery life. With all day use of netflix and toutube video, tuning songs , games..4)it has real HD quality display , suitable for streaming netflix and youtube videos.5) i feel it has light body due to fibre back cover.6)Above all has the brand logo of samsung..Cons1)I thought that there was disturbance and noise while phone call.. and i was annoyyed but figured out that it was the network problem of sim operator..So the conclusion is no cons yet

    Writing review after using 2 months.Amoled display is good.Camera is hyped. Not that great.Lacking to perform daily regular task.Hangs a lot. Need to restart each time.Initially 1 month full battery charge was taking around 2.5 hours . Now it's taking 8-9 hours.

    Best high end device within budget in market. This time Samsung team have outdone themselves. Samsung m31 beats 24000 rs smartphones available in marketAmazing display qualityAwesome pixel density 411 ppiSmooth performanceSuperb lookBattery size is monstrous 6000mah biggest in normal smartphone market. First time i feel like i don't have to charge my smartphone all the time.Camera quality is also also awesomeI was amazed when i saw this phone and purchased it on the day it launched.Yes it take little longer to charge it but its obvious because of its battery size.If you want best smartphone under 25k go for it.Thank you Samsung for making such a device possible :)

    This is a monster mobile. Monster in good sense. Very good battery life well full battery charge take some time well its obvious its 6000 mah battery. Camera quality is best. Not tested 64 mp till now coz its 3 days review, front camera is really awesome. Single speakers and its loud enough. Did not received  earphones in the box, apart from that its the best mobile under this budget. 4.5 star go for it. More over It's Samsung.

    It has a decent camera with numerous features...........night mode is not very good it is just ok. But other features of camera do not let you feel the shortcoming of night mode.Performance vise, it is good with fast speed and doesn't lag due to it's big ram. This phone doesn't provide bixby as A series doSetting and notification panel provide many features  for great experience.Biometrics is good...........1 out of 8 times fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize you but works good even with wet hands.......face lock is also decent.The features that stand out from all of these are........its screen with amoled display is simply treat to our eyes, battery charger could be more fast but still it is good, performance and classiness.................if your budget is around 15 to 16k then you can definitely look upto this mobile

    I was not so happy with the last samsung phone i used in 2013 and all these years i was using other brands and finally i decided to buy Samsung galaxy M31 6GB, 128 GB version..i had compared with other phones in this segment including realme, redmi, vivo and oppo.after a lots of home work i went for this one and in simple words it is amazing.in terms of performance, display and battery , its simply the best i would say. Finger print reader works very nice..its fast too.and even face recognition  works fast. The siper display is to he mentioned.and no heating problmes so far.and camera 64 MP back cam offers very good photo experience and 32MP selfie cam is also mind blowing. Battery life is to be mentioned in double inverted comas.its really awesome. It stays for almost one and half days. Multi tasking works very nice.In short as the name suggests, its a monster..i love the new Samsung galaxy M31 experience

    Am only writing the cons:-1.) Front canera quality 5years backward..(its a quality with 12MP micromax camera instead of 32 MP)2.) HEATING ISSUE IS THERE... ALMOST UPPER <U+2153> HEATS LIKE ANYTHING....( EXYNOS chipset is poorer, past experiences from many users..i personally rely for a Snapdragon chipset... )But This time i overestimated exynos & i fail...*Exynos is a samsung made chipset cheaply produced but most performed chipset are always with Snapdragon thus the phones they possess...Exynos 9611 used in..14k galaxy m31...24k galaxy a31 and goes on i donno what they mean by this.. unusual distribution...3.) Facial recognition takes time far poorer than my poco f1 but fingerprint scanner is ok but not that fast still ok...

    Samsung M31 is a Best quality product having  the great performance and built quality is also good with the latest Android 10 That is available in chipest price.M31's comes with 64mp quad camera and 6.4 Amoled display are amazing.Camera comes with lots of modes likeSlow motion, super-slow-mo, live focus,  macro shot, night mode, ultra wide shot & many more filters. 3 stars to it's battery lifeBecause  while using phone it releasing  heat.Samsung  announced  that the new M31 will come with 6000mAh battery although the performance  is good but battery life is not satisfactory.In other hand i will say that it has the 6000 mAh battery  but the charger  is 15V that is not suitable  to charge a heavy battery.

    This phone is really good in day to day tasks. But it's processing power is not that good, sometimes it overheats while playing heavy games such as call of duty mobile and pubg mobile. As for the camera quality the daylight photos are crystal clear but the night photos are a bit blurry if you have shaky hands. Battery will last 1.5 days more or less and 2 if there is no Ga(y)ming involved. Oh and this phone probably has the best screen under 20k I haven't seen the other phones but this one is an one of a kind. There are some other small features that makes the phone easy to use too, so over all 4.5 out of 5 because of over heating during gaming and the rest is ten out of ten.

    Phone is worth at this price range. Comparing to the phone i have used before like Nokia, the cameras of Samsung galaxy M31 is missing details in the pictures, but is good in low light. Overall the the cameras are really good compared to other Samsung phones in this price range. I love the full black body, when the phone is used in dark screen mode, it absolutely a great feel of having very nice gadget at hand - Hats off to the design here. Ofcourse, the display is superb. And battery life is really a plus on this phone. A great product to own! Though, the charger i recieved in the box is defective, its not working, i had to use my other chargers to charge my phone because i didn't like to exchange my phone just for the defective charger.

    Likes:1) The fingerprint reader works perfectly well even if the finger is sweaty.2) Camera is fabulous in each and every mode.3) Battery life as defined by the tag is a mega monster.It easily lasts the whole day with heavy usage and can last two days with light use.4) The display is amazing,it is an awesome experience watching HD videos on the SuperAmoled display.5) The always on display feature that Samsung has provided is appreciable.6) Dolby Atmos gives a magical music experience.7) The light weight design with such a big battery says all about the intelligent designing of the phone.Dislikes:1) The face recognition is a little disappointing as it does not work up to the expectations.It takes little more than the normal time to unlock phone with this.2) The wifi connectivity is a little slow

    Should appriciate the effort made by samsung on M31,If u are a tiktoker, vlogger, camera lover, this phone is for youThere are many phones with good cameras and yes better than Samsung M31 but you will not satisfy as this beast make you satisfy with the features like super slowmo, slowmo, macro, nightmode etcThe best part is, the person who doesn't like his face or he is camera shy and loves doing vlogs, AR emoji will help him to creates his face and you can do video on it.With AR emoji u can do some awesome tiktok as well.You can visit my tiktok ID for videos @hemantmachaniAlso appriciated Amazon quick delivery, not a prime member but still i received this phone in 2 days.

    Good Smartphone, looks great when not using any back cover. Battery is awesome. Display is good and crisp. Camera is good though a bit disappointed on picture comparison with other smartphone within range as colors are little offtone. May be have not much clicked photo in daylight bright condition where clicks can be taken for any occasion or photography can be done.Good features like dark mode,Dolby atmos, smart view. Camera macro shot is amazing.Back panel attracts fingerprints.Overall good phone.

    This phone has Very good display. Sound quality is decent. Camera and Battery are excellent and in day to day life phone is very easy to use and doesn't feel heavy. Thanks to the Samsung UI all my with Android Q it's clean and simple. Speaker is not so loud. Fingure print reader is fast. I also played many games like asphalt 9 and did face any lagging issue because of 6 GB ram. Multitasking is very well handled. The body is little delicate so you need a protective case. Overall it's a good phone and also made in India.

    The mobile by itself is a master piece of technology and the highlights are the camera's and battery.  Value for money and promise kept well by Samsung.  This is our 4th Samsung mobile we've bought through Amazon and all are working hassle free. This master piece outwits redmi or Huawei by miles in performance and battery life. The draw back is that its has a heavy built and weighs a bit. But Indian people like the reliability than looks. To sum up,  this is a monster of a deal.

    It's the best mid ranger phone. It's has everything what a person needs. Big battery which is its wow feature, it helps me to not to charge  a phone for 2 days. Camera has it's top notch quality. The front notch has pleasant design and it is waterproof, as I have tested. Fingerprint reader is very  much fast as compared to other phones. It's  sleek and lightweight  as it's  have 6000 MAH battery but it doesn't feel bulky. I prefer you to buy this without comparing because it's the best monster.

    The features are all fine. But if you use it continuously for 20 minutes, it will get heated to an unbearable extent.I checked if there is any solution for this. The solution is to reduce brightness and use fewer number of apps.But one buys a smartphone to use the apps!

Skin texture gets smoothened .Battery ....I don't play games ..and neither do I watch movies . Just regular social media apps and WhatsApp . Even my calls are very less. Still the bulky battery just lasts bit more than a day. And it takes bit long to fast charge ...which feels as if it's not fast charging.

    Hardware wise nothing to complain about everything is great but can use some software touches like camera i think the software need an upgrade the pictures taken get soften too much and the details get compromised, the fingerprint reader is fast the Samoled looks great!. Stock android would have been great had to uninstall a lot of unnecessary applications other UI is great and oh the battery life this baby could last ages long battery life one full charge and this will last all day even with heavy usages

    I got around  2 days battery life in single charge  but It takes much time for charging  6000 mah battery  approximately 2 and half  hour. My small suggestion  is  Samsung should have provided 25 watt charger instead of 15 watt. Camera clarity of the phone  is good as compared to other phones in this price range and the processor too. The fingerprint sensor and face recognition  is much faster and we can unlock the  phone  within 1 or 2 seconds.

    I never tried Samsung gadgets and in the era of so many new phones, I thought to give this phone a try.But this phone is trouble, the processing is so slow, the phone Is very heavy. The camera is okay but not good. It's been 3 days I bought the phone and I had put a guard and back cover still the display is dead. I have never seen any display as well as the screen so weak that it can't bear a small tear.Amazon people were also not very helpful.

    The Camera Quality is quite good. However  would have liked Pro mode to be better with more manual controls. Fingerprint reader is slower compared to my old mobile but doesn't disappoint in any way. Battery life is enough for a day's use with moderate activity. Given the  battery size, better battery life expected. The mobile is a bit heavier and somewhat lags in performance but makes up for it in the features provided.

     I found this phone to be really a monster in terms of it's battery. It's display is literally fascinating at this price range. It's features, updates and sensors are well good and decent. I found that it's camera is not upto the mark but it's not compromising either. Being samsung, it hangs sometimes but recovers within 3-4 sec. Overall a nice phone to buy at this price range with a samsung tag.

    I have not seen a phone with that much erratic  charging. Sometimes it takes 3-4 hours and sometimes longer than that. I have done all I could like restarting, closing background apps, closing location and syncing. I feel terrible about buying this phone earlier I got a defected piece which I have returned and now again I am frustratingly disappointed. Also, I think the camera quality is not like 64 megapixel especially macro lens.

    Delivery -on timeSamsung M31 is nice phone with a great camera. Selfie camera lack a little bit crispnessLoved the wide angle lens photography. Phone work fluidly well and there is no lag in performance. Battery is amazing need a full charge after 2days. Just one negative thing is the back plastic panel can get scrached easily So I m satisfied with the phone.

    In this phone I faced many issues like overheating, hanging,  app download problem from play store, problem during calling also.Camera is average.Battery life is not like 6000mah.Biggest reason I don't like and not recognize purchase from Amazon is they not replaced or refund my money when I complained before 17th March 2020. I'm still waiting for refund that not done till date.

    Overall an excellent phone by Samsung. What surprised me was the battery backup. Even though I play Call of Duty for about 2-3 hours a day, I can go more than 24 hours without charging. The camera is excellent too. The Samsung Galaxy M31 is the best phone I have used till date. Infact it is way better than phones segments above it. Close youe eyes and buy this one. Good job Samsung!
